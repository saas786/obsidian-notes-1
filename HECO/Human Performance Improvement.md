## Common Error Precursors

- ==on "trap ahead" card==


- task demands
- individual capabilities
- work environment
- human nature

### Time Pressure

### Distractions / Interruptions

### Multiple Tasks

## Human Performance Toolbox

### Two Minute Drill
Take two minutes to review for safe, error-free tasks.

==The first step to safe and error-free operations is recognizing the Error Precursors that exist in the work environment.==

### Pre-Job Brief

When to use:
-	Prior to performing a task or activity that is non-routine
-	Prior to performing a task or activity that is considered routine, but for which an improper outcome cannot be tolerated
-	After shift or individual turnover or after significant time lapses while the task or activity is in progress

#### SAFER
-	summarize critical steps
-	anticipate error-likely situations
-	foresee consequences
-	evaluate defenses
-	review operating experience

### Three-way Communication

==reason to use==:
-	to provide clear, concise and complete transfer of information
-	to ensure that the intended message is received and understood
-	to minimize the potential for making errors because of poor communication

### Self-Checking (==STAR==):
-	stop
-	think
-	act
-	review

when to use:
- ==before and during manipulation of any plant equipment==
-	during time pressures (for example, employee feeling rushed)
-	when identifiying components (for locating tags, reading prints, and so on)
-	during task interruptions
-	during distractions
-	before critical or risk-significant steps identified during a pre-job brief

### Peer-Checking
Used in conjunction with self-checking (STAR).

### Questioning Attitude

### Procedure Use & Adherence: Placekeeping

__placekeeping__ -- the act of marking steps in a procecedure as they are completed or marking the steps that are not applicable
-	circle current step
-	when step is completed, cross it

==Use levels:==
-	Continuous use
-	Reference use
-	Information use

### Do Not Disturb

### Time Out
Used by an individual or team to take a brief moment to assess the situation and discuss specific conditions and assumptions. This is to verify that the most accurate information is avaliable before proceeding.

When to use:
-	When a task, activity or plant condition changes
-	When there is uncertainty with regards to intended actions
-	When results from actions taken are not as expected

### Problem Solving
RCA - Roots Cause Analysis

### Post Job Review - Task Debrief

## Leading Error Reduction

### Human Error
- skill based
- knowledge based
- rule based
