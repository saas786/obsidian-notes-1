### Safety Valves
Relieves pressure to prevent damage to the boiler by exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure.

They open when the internal pressure exceeds a set point. Once the pressure goes below the set point, it closes back up.

Two types:
- DIN (German-based, used in Europe)
- ASME (used in US)

#### Electromatic Relief Valve (ERV)
Located upstream from relief valve. It is usually set to relieve before the other regular safety valves in order to minimize maintenence of them. Operators either automatically or manually.
