A **solenoid** is an electronically powered coil of wire with a moveable core of soft iron or other permeable material.

When current passes through the coil, a magnetic field is created, causing the core to move into the coil (known as **solenoid action**).

This is used as an actuator for a control valve that is able to open/close it. There is no way to throttle a valve with a solenoid.
