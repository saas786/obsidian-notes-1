# 17. Make-up Water System
---

Objectives:
1.	Discuss the supply or source of water for water purification systems
2.	Describe the pretreatment of water in water purification systems
3.	Discuss the methods used to produce high purity water
4.	Describe how purified water is stored and transferred

[[4. Power Plant Chemistry#Chemical Properties|Chemical Properties of Water]]

## Supply / Source
**raw water** -- the water used to make demineralized water (the supply)
Raw water is pumped directly to the demineralizers.

Sources for raw water:
-	wells (sea water)
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 10,000 umhos
-	domestic (city) water
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 350 umhos
-	raw water
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 700 umhos
-	recycled water (processed city water)

# Purifying Water
Need for pure water:
-	HECO's design of the boiler, steam piping, turbines
	-	all metallic surfaces
	-	boilers are carbon steel
		-	when boiling water, consistent heating and flow are preffered
		-	ions will interrupt the desired heating and flow
	-	steam piping / turbine blades varies (stainless, chrome-moly)
		-	ions will corrode these surfaces, interrupt
