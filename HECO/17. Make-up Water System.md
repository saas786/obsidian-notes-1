Objectives:
1.	Discuss the supply or source of water for water purification systems
2.	Describe the pretreatment of water in water purification systems
3.	Discuss the methods used to produce high purity water
4.	Describe how purified water is stored and transferred

[[4. Power Plant Chemistry#Chemical Properties|Chemical Properties of Water]]

## Supply / Source
**raw water** -- the water used to make demineralized water (the supply)
Raw water is pumped directly to the demineralizers.

Sources for raw water:
-	wells (sea water)
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 10,000 umhos
-	domestic (city) water
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 350 umhos
-	raw water
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 700 umhos
-	recycled water (processed city water)

## Purifying Water
Need for pure water:
-	Prevents corrosion of the steam piping and turbine blades
-	Maintains consistent heating and flow in the boiler

-	HECO's design of the boiler, steam piping, turbines
	-	all metallic surfaces
	-	boilers are carbon steel
		-	when boiling water, consistent heating and flow are preffered
		-	ions will interrupt the desired heating and flow
	-	steam piping / turbine blades varies (stainless, chrome-moly)
		-	ions will corrode these surfaces, interrupt steam flow

Methods of removing dissolved solids:
1.	Reverse Osmosis (RO) -- used at Waiau
2.	Demineralizer -- used at Kahe

## Pretreatment
Starts the purification process (removal of suspended solids).

-	Multi Media Filters (MMF) / Sand Filters
	-	sand filter that removes suspended particles with sizes greater than 10 microns
-	Poly Styrene Filters
	-	normally used to remove suspended solids with sizes greater than 5 microns
	
Chemical Injection:
-	Some RO systems use anti-scaling or pH control to prepare the water entering the RO membranes

### MMF
-	3 MMF
-	Reduces turbidity of water -- removes suspended solids
-	Solids entrained within filtration media
	-	filtration media with varying densities
	-	stratify into different layers
-	Backwash to clean

## Dimineralizer Systems

### Reverse Osmosis (RO)
In reverse osmosis, pressure is applied to water containing dissolved solids, which forces (only pure) water through the membrane.

Waiau:
-	Raw water used as feed water to demineralizer system
	-	ground or well water (Artesian wells)
	-	city water
	
Components:
-	Forwarding pumps
	-	increases pressure of water to inlet
-	RO membranes (array)
	-	2 banks
-	Polishing unit
	-	Electrodeionization (EDI) unit
	-	Mixed Bed Resin

RO Unit:
-	Uses semi-permeable membranes
-	Two (double) pass RO system
-	High pressure pumps

Electrodeionization (EDI) Unit:
-	Polishing step to remove traces of dissolved solids
-	Water directed through multiple channels
	-	ion exchange resin
	-	voltage applied
-	5 EDI modules
### Demineralizer
Components:
-	Cation Vessel
-	Degassifier
-	Anion Vessel
-	Mixed Bed Vessel
