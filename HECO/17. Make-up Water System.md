# 17. Make-up Water System
---

Objectives:
1.	Discuss the supply or source of water for water purification systems
2.	Describe the pretreatment of water in water purification systems
3.	Discuss the methods used to produce high purity water
4.	Describe how purified water is stored and transferred

High purity water is essential to (1) ==prevent corrosion== and (2) ==control scale== to ensure continued operation of a steam plant.

[[4. Power Plant Chemistry#Chemical Properties|Chemical Properties of Water]]
## Water Chemistry
Reasons why water is an ideal material for steam driven generators:
1.	==Water is a very effective heat transfer medium== because it is capable of absorbing and releasing great quantities of heat
	-	It takes 1 BTU to raise the temperature of a pound of water 1 F. If condensate starts at 100 F, it takes 1082 BTU to raise a pound of water to 1182 F, steam temperature.
2.	==Steam has the ability to store up the great amount of heat energy== absorbed by the water, and is able to release this energy at the turbine, thus converting it to useful mechanical energy
3.	==Steam can be recycled as feedwater to reuse in the steam generating cycle.== After performing its useful work at the turbine, the steam can be condensed and recovered as feedwater to be used over again in the steam generating cycle
4. ==Water is abundant and cheap.== Water is an abundant natural resource, and from an economic standpoint, it is cheap because of its avalability

## Supply / Source
**raw water** -- the water used to make demineralized water (the supply)
Raw water is pumped directly to the demineralizers.

Sources for raw water:
-	wells (sea water)
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 10,000 umhos
-	domestic (city) water
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 350 umhos
-	raw water
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 700 umhos
-	recycled water (processed city water)

## Purifying Water
Need for pure water:
-	Prevents corrosion of the steam piping and turbine blades
-	Maintains consistent heating and flow in the boiler

-	HECO's design of the boiler, steam piping, turbines
	-	all metallic surfaces
	-	boilers are carbon steel
		-	when boiling water, consistent heating and flow are preffered
		-	ions will interrupt the desired heating and flow
	-	steam piping / turbine blades varies (stainless, chrome-moly)
		-	ions will corrode these surfaces, interrupt steam flow

Methods of removing dissolved solids:
1.	Reverse Osmosis (RO) -- used at Waiau
2.	Demineralizer -- used at Kahe

## Pretreatment
Starts the purification process (removal of suspended solids).

Two methods:
-	**Filtration**
	-	Multi Media Filters (MMF) / Sand Filters
		-	sand filter that removes suspended particles with sizes greater than 10 microns
	-	Poly Styrene Filters
		-	normally used to remove suspended solids with sizes greater than 5 microns
-	**Reverse Osmosis (RO)**
	-	Some RO systems use anti-scaling or pH control to prepare the water entering the RO membranes (chemical injection)
	
### Multi Media Filters
Function: removes suspended solids from raw water (reduces turbidity of water)

-	3 MMFs
-	Solids entrained within filtration media
	-	filtration media with varying densities
	-	stratify into different layers
-	Backwash to clean

## Dimineralizer Systems

Waiau: raw water -> reverse osmosis system
Kahe: raw water -> reverse osmosis -> demineralizer

### Reverse Osmosis (RO)
In reverse osmosis, pressure is applied to water containing dissolved solids, which forces (only pure) water through the membrane.

Advantages:
-	Simple to operate
-	Energy efficient

Waiau:
-	Raw water used as feed water to demineralizer system
	-	ground or well water (Artesian wells)
	-	city water
	
Components:
-	Forwarding pumps
	-	increases pressure of water to inlet
-	Array of RO membranes
	-	2 banks
	-	Uses semi-permeable membranes
	-	Two (double) pass RO system
	-	High pressure pumps
-	Polishing unit
	-	Electrodeionization (EDI) unit
	-	Mixed Bed Resin
	
Resin: material added to a solution for the purpose of causing a reaction

RO Unit:

Electrodeionization (EDI) Unit:
-	==Removes traces of dissolved solids==
-	Water directed through multiple channels
	-	ion exchange resin
	-	voltage applied
-	5 EDI modules

### Demineralizer
-	RO water used as feed water
-	Ion exchange takes place to purify water

Components:
-	Cation Vessel
	-	vessel where cations are exchanged ($Fe^{3+}, Ca^{2+}, Mg^{2+}, Na^{+}$)
-	Degassifier
	-	removes gases, mainly carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$)
-	Anion Vessel
	-	vessel where anions are exhanged (pottasium, sulfur, chlorine, carbonate)
-	Mixed Bed Vessel 

Synthetic resins can be damaged if:
-	Exposed to high temperatures (> 140 F)
-	Exposed to organics (e.g. oil)

#### RO Water
-	Reclaimed water
-	Minerals removed, bacteria and other organic material may still be in water
-	For use as irrigation, industrial use
-	Not potable
