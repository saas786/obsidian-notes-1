# 17. Make-up Water System
---

Objectives:
1.	Discuss the supply or source of water for water purification systems
2.	Describe the pretreatment of water in water purification systems
3.	Discuss the methods used to produce high purity water
4.	Describe how purified water is stored and transferred

[[4. Power Plant Chemistry#Chemical Properties|Chemical Properties of Water]]

## Supply / Source
**raw water** -- the water used to make demineralized water (the supply)
Raw water is pumped directly to the demineralizers.

Sources for raw water:
-	wells (sea water)
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 10,000 umhos
-	domestic (city) water
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 350 umhos
-	raw water
	-	pH = 7.5
	-	conductivity = 700 umhos
-	recycled water (processed city water)
