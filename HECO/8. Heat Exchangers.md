# 8. Heat Exchangers
---

The term ==heat exchanger applies to any piece of equipment designed to transfer heat==. In a power plant, this applies to power plant auxillary equipment where heat is transferred from one fluid to another.

Two main types:
1. feedwater heaters
2. condensers
3. and other types

## ![[Feedwater Heater]]

## Countercurrent Flow
Occurs when two mediums are flowing in the opposite direction.

Hottest steam entering is transferring heat to the hottest feedwater leaving. This maintains a minimum [[Terminal Temperature Difference|TTD]] between the steam and feedwater at all times.

## Heaters and the Cycle
Heaters are numbered in reverse order in which steam is extracted from the turbine.
-	Extraction Steam #1 to #5, High-to-low
-	Heaters #1 to #5, Low-to-high

### Cascading Drain System
Ideally, drains would be collected and pumped into the condensor/feedwater after leaving the heater. But, this would require a pump after every heater.

In the cascading drain system, drains are sent to the next lower heater. Drains flash to steam due to the lower pressure.

Drain flow increases from #5 to #1 heater
-	#5 -> extraction steam
-	#4 -> extraction steam + drains from #5
-	#3 -> extraction steam + drains from #4
-	#2 -> extraction steam + drains from #3
-	#1 -> extraction steam + drains from #2

A **heater drip tank** is placed at the end of a cascade of high-pressure heaters to collect drips, where the __heater drip pump__ (HDP) pumps the water from into the boiler feed pump suction.
The end of a cascade of low-pressure heaters is connected to the main condenser.

#### Heater Level Control
Drains to the lower heater are regulated. This is controlled with a __normal level control valve__ (NLCV).

-	Alternate drain disposal route
	-	High level dump goes back to the main condenser
	-	This is for safety and maintenence
	
For example, if maintenence needs to be done on heater #4, the NLCV connecting the #5 drain to #4 is closed. Then, the drain from #5 is sent to the condensor on a different line.

## ![[Condenser]]

## Plate Heat Exchangers
-	Thin corrugated metal heat transfer plates
-	Frame to compress the plates together
-	Plates are typically stainless steel
	-	can be titanium
-	Pairs of plates form a channel for the fluids to flow
-	Gaskets on the plates for sealing, which prevents mixing of the fluids

Used for liquid-to-liquid heat exchange. The hot and cold fluids flow across the plates and up and down the plates in an alternating pattern. This exchange is achieved through ==conduction==.
-	Used in Kahe 3, 4, 5 & 6 chillers
-	Aux Cooling Water and Sea Water

Some can now be used for low pressure and low temperature steam
-	Brazed plates

Advantages:
-	==Compact size==
	-	two plate and frame in the space for one shell and tube
-	==Turbulent flow of fluid==, which increases heat transfer efficiency
-	Can ==adjust heat transfer capacity== by adding or removing plates

==Main components:== ^d290f6
-	Heat transfer plates
-	Fixed covers
-	Support column
-	Moveable cover
-	Gasket
-	Carrying bar
-	Tightening bolt
-	Guide bar

## Reboilers
A [[Shell and Tube Heater]].
-	Steam in the tube side
-	Water in the shell side

The steam is used to heat fuel oil for boilers.

## Other Heat Exchangers
-	air ejector condenser
-	chillers -- cools aux cooling water
	-	used to cool lube oil
	-	used to cool large bearings
	-	used to cool boiler doors
-	fuel oil heaters
-	lube oil coolers
