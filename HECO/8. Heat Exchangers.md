# 8. Heat Exchangers
---

Term applies to any piece of equipment designed to transfer heat. In a power plant, this applies to power plant auxillary equipment where heat is transferred from one fluid to another.

Two main types:
1. feedwater heaters
2. condensers
3. and other types

## Feedwater Heaters
Uses extraction steam from the turbine to pre-heat the water entering the boiler.

A [[Shell and Tube Heater]] where feedwater enters the tube side through the feedwater inlet and the inlet water box and flows to through the tubes to the outlet water box. Extraction steam, taken from the turbine, enters the extraction steam inlet to the shell side and is used to heat the feedwater.

In a high pressure feedwater heater (a feedwater heater that takes extraction steam from the HP section of the turbine), steam enters the feedwater heater at a superheated temperature. Some heaters may contain a desuperheating section (occurs before the condenser section) where the steam is cooled to a saturation temperature.
