A feedwater heater that is used to remove non-condensible gases from the condensor and recovers heat from the ejected air. 

Auxillary steam is fed through steam jet nozzles which pushes any air and non-condensible gases from the main condensor through the shell side, condensing it and discharges the vapors into the atmosphere. 

Condensate flows through the tube side and is heated by the steam-air mixture.

This heat exchanger operates above atmospheric pressure.
