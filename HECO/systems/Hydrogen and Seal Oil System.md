>1. The major limit to generator capability is the ability of the design to cool which material?

copper

>2. What are the advantages of hydrogen over air with respect to generator cooling?

-	low density
-	high thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients
-	pure -> free of dirt and moisture
	-	increases life of insulation of stator winding
-	reduced windage noise

>3. Cooling active conductors internally has allowed for an increase in the capacities of generators. True \ False

true

>4. Liquid has better heat transfer characteristics as compared with gas. True \ False

false

>5. An explosion could occur if hydrogen is mixed with ________ .

air

>6. The pumps that maintain stator cooling water circulation may be started ________ .
>a. automatically.
>b. manually.
>c. both of the above.

both of the above

>7. The pressure of oil maintained on the seal at all times must be higher than hydrogen pressure to provide adequate sealing. True \ False

true

>8. Oil will absorb moisture and gas. True \ False 

true

>9. How does absorption of moisture and gas affect the hydrogen system?

-	lowers the purity of the hydrogen
-	increases windage
-	decreases efficiency

>10. What system provides seal oil backup?

turbine lube oil system

>11. In some gas dryers, the colored activated alumina is a ________ color when dry and changing to ________ when moist.

blue to grayish-pink

>12. Hydrogen gas systems are all provided with some means of reading machine gas purity. Two of these are:

1.	purity meter (changes thermal conductivity)
2.	density meter

>13. What is used as an intermediate gas when changing either from air to hydrogen or hydrogen to air in a generator? Why is this gas used?

carbon dioxide; CO2 is an inert gas that doesn't react with hydrogen

>14. Under normal operating conditions, the hydrogen purity in a vacuum system is maintained at a value of 94-96%. True \ False

false; 98-99%

>15. Describe the difference(s) in the oil supplied to the seals with the vacuum system in service and without the vacuum system in service.

-	no vacuum system
	-	less clean gas
	-	lower purity gas

>16. Why do we have a seal oil system?

prevents the hydrogen from escaping the generator

>17. To prevent the escape of gas along the shaft of a hydrogen cooled turbine generator, ________ seals supplied with oil under pressure are used. 

shaft or glands

>18. Discuss, briefly, the purpose of the defoaming tanks.

removes the foam from the oil; the foam contains hydrogen

>19. What is the purpose of the vacuum tank? How does the vacuum tank work?

-	removes gas & water vapor from the oil
-	


>20. Draw a diagram of the seal oil system. Include all major equipment and label each piece of equipment. Show flow, including direction of flow of oil from the generator seals through the seal oil system.
