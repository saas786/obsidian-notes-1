>How could oil get into the water?

Facility Drainage
-	Berms with valves
-	Undiked areas
-	Storm drains

>What is regulated?

1.	**Bulk Storage Containers**
Any container that is used primarily to store oil and is 55 gallons or larger
2.	**Oil-Filled Equipment**
Motors, pumps, transformers, lubricating systems, piping 55 gallons or larger

Bulk Storage Container
-	Tank Construction
	-	Compatibility
-	Secondary Containment
	-	Containment sized for the entire volume of the largest container plus freeboard for rainwater
	-	Ex: Berms, Spill Pallets
-	Drainage of Rainwater
	-	Closed and locked valve and/or secured pumps
-	Examples: Tanks, Drums
-	Generators with internal storage also need secondary containment
	-	Sometimes secondary containment built into generator
-	Internal Heating Coils
	-	Heating coils within tank may leak and provide a pathway for oil
	-	Systems that exit containment are more of a concern
	-	Facilities with heating coils include Kahe, Waiau, Barbers Point and Kahului

Level Sensing Devices
-	Required for all bulk storage containers filled through a hose (w/ connectors) or pipe
-	Varec, radar, float, sight glass, etc.
-	Must be "calibrated" periodcally
	-	Comparison with other gauging method is sufficient

Alternative Overfill Prevention
-	Small volme of each transfer
	-	ex. 5-gal bucket into larger container
-	Low transfer rate (gpm)
-	Infrequent transfers
	-	ex. few times per year
-	Must be fully attended
-	Must gauge tank or visually check level of container prior to transfer

Mobile Storage
-	Tanker Trucks, Totes, Drums
-	Becomes a Bulk Storage Container once they become immobile

Oil-Filled Equipment
-	Equipment that requires oil to operate (motors, pumps, transformers)
-	Spill Prevention System
-	Transformers -> gravel around equipment
	-	Out of Service Transformers (manned facilities)
		-	store indoors or under cover if possible
		-	only new or reconditioned transfomers should be stored outdoors
		-	inspect transformers
	-	inservice transformer
		-	inspections	
		-	gravel
		
Mobile Refuelers
-	Bulk storage container onboard a cehicle or towed used solely to transfer oil into other sotrage containers
-	Spill Prevention requirement same as oil filled equipment
-	Inspections and drip pans

Exempt Items
-	Vehicles (Trucks, crains, bulldozers, etc.)
	-	The oil and gas "tanks" permanently fixed to a vehicle for the purpose of powering the vehicle are exempt from the rule
-	Oil/Water Separators
	-	If oil is pumped out of the separator into another tank, that tank is considered bulk storage

Vehicle Fueling
-	Must be present during fueling. Do not lock dispenser
-	No "topping off"
-	Report suspect equipment. (Cracked hoses, faulty dispenser, etc.)

Inspections
-	Tanks, Drums, Barrels, Transformers
-	Dike or Berm System
	-	Level of Precipitation
	-	Percent Available Capacity
	-	Operational Status of Drain Valves
	-	Dike or Berm Permeability
	-	Debris
	-	Erosion
-	Secondary Containment
-	Conducted monthly
-	Maintained for at least 5 years
-	Periodic integrity testing (API or STI)
	-	American Petrolum Institute
	-	Steel I
	
-	Leaks
-	Drip marks
-	Discoloration
-	Puddles
-	Corrosion
-	Cracks
-	Localized Dead Vegitation
-	

Spill Response equipment
-	Spill kits
-	Absorbent Pads
-	Booms
-	Occasionally swap out material in the spill kit with new material from storeroom

Spill Response
1.	Source control - stop the leak
2.	Notification
3.	Containment
	-	Stop/slow the flow
	-	Block discharge routes (storm drains)
4.	Zone Control
	-	Hot Zone, decon, PPE
5.	Recovery

Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)
-	ensures the water quality of the facility's runoff
-	identifies potential sources of pollution
-	includes Best Management Practices (BMP)

BMP
-	if it can be picked up and thrown away, do so
-	if it can be swept up, sweep it up
-	if you cannot the impact of your activity, at least minimize it
-	doing something is better than nothing, just do it right

BMPs for Waste Storage Areas
-	Close dumpster lids when not in use
-	Periodically inspect the condition of the dumpster
-	Sweep area surrounding the bins
-	Store under overhangs
-	Construct berms around area

BMPs for Painting, Sandblasting, or Grinding
-	Use tarps to cover ground
-	Sweep up dust, sand, and paint chips daily, at a minimum
-	Enclose blast area with tarps or plastic sheeting
-	Leaving waste material on the ground is unacceptable
-	Paint on asphalt -> use asphalt coating

Storm Water Accumulated in Berms
-	Obtain supervisor approval to discharge
-	Only discharge clean storm water
-	Record draining activity on log sheet
-	Close and lock drain after draining activity
	-	or isolate pumps
-	The clean storm water can be discharged to the ground or storm drains

Metals
-	All metal subject to significant corrosion must be stored under cover or indoors
-	Rust scale on the ground is unacceptable
-	Any amount of metal on the ground is too much
-	Building and structures also can contribute to stormwater

Reduce Runoff
-	Allow storm water to infiltrate into the ground
-	Create buffers
-	Slow down the flow

Inspections and Monitoring
-	Facility inspections are required quarterly
	-	Inspection forms ce
