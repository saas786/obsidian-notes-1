>How could oil get into the water?

Facility Drainage
-	Berms with valves
-	Undiked areas
-	Storm drains

>What is regulated?

1.	**Bulk Storage Containers**
Any container that is used primarily to store oil and is 55 gallons or larger
2.	**Oil-Filled Equipment**
Motors, pumps, transformers, lubricating systems, piping 55 gallons or larger

Bulk Storage Container
-	Tank Construction
	-	Compatibility
-	Secondary Containment
	-	Containment sized for the entire volume of the largest container plus freeboard for rainwater
	-	Ex: Berms, Spill Pallets
-	Drainage of Rainwater
	-	Closed and locked valve and/or secured pumps
-	Examples: Tanks, Drums
-	Generators with internal storage also need secondary containment
	-	Sometimes secondary containment built into generator
-	Internal Heating Coils
	-	Heating coils within tank may leak and provide a pathway for oil
	-	Systems that exit containment are more of a concern
	-	Facilities with heating coils include Kahe, Waiau, Barbers Point and Kahului

Level Sensing Devices
-	Required for all bulk storage containers filled through a hose (w/ connectors) or pipe
-	Varec, radar, float, sight glass, etc.
-	Must be "calibrated" periodcally
	-	Comparison with other gauging method is sufficient

Alternative Overfill Prevention
-	Small volme of each transfer
	-	ex. 5-gal bucket into larger container
-	Low transfer rate (gpm)
-	Infrequent transfers
	-	ex. few times per year
-	Must be fully attended
-	Must gauge tank or visually check level of container prior to transfer
