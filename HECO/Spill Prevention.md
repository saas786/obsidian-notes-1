>How could oil get into the water?

Facility Drainage
-	Berms with valves
-	Undiked areas
-	Storm drains

>What is regulated?

1.	**Bulk Storage Containers**
Any container that is used primarily to store oil and is 55 gallons or larger
2.	**Oil-Filled Equipment**
Motors, pumps, transformers, lubricating systems, piping 55 gallons or larger

Bulk Storage Container
-	Tank Construction
	-	Compatibility
-	Secondary Containment
	-	Containment sized for the entire volume of the largest container plus freeboard for rainwater
	-	Ex: Berms, Spill Pallets
-	Drainage of Rainwater
	-	Closed and locked valve and/or secured pumps
-	Examples: Tanks, Drums
-	Generators with internal storage also need secondary containment
	-	Sometimes secondary containment built into generator
-	Internal Heating Coils
	-	Heating coils within tank may leak and provide a pathway for oil
	-	Systems that exit containment are more of a concern
	-	Facilities with heating coils include Kahe, Waiau, Barbers Point and Kahului

Level Sensing Devices
-	Required for all bulk storage containers filled through a hose (w/ connectors) or pipe
-	Varec, radar, float, sight glass, etc.
-	Must be "calibrated" periodcally
	-	Comparison with other gauging method is sufficient

Alternative Overfill Prevention
-	Small volme of each transfer
	-	ex. 5-gal bucket into larger container
-	Low transfer rate (gpm)
-	Infrequent transfers
	-	ex. few times per year
-	Must be fully attended
-	Must gauge tank or visually check level of container prior to transfer

Mobile Storage
-	Tanker Trucks, Totes, Drums
-	Becomes a Bulk Storage Container once they become immobile

Oil-Filled Equipment
-	Equipment that requires oil to operate (motors, pumps, transformers)
-	Spill Prevention System
-	Transformers -> gravel around equipment
	-	Out of Service Transformers (manned facilities)
		-	store indoors or under cover if possible
		-	only new or reconditioned transfomers should be stored outdoors
		-	inspect transformers
	-	inservice transformer
		-	inspections	
		-	gravel
		
Mobile Refuelers
-	Bulk storage container onboard a cehicle or towed used solely to transfer oil into other sotrage containers
-	Spill Prevention requirement same as oil filled equipment
-	Inspections and drip pans

Exempt Items
-	Vehicles (Trucks, crains, bulldozers, etc.)
	-	The oil and gas "tanks" permanently fixed to a vehicle for the purpose of powering the vehicle are exempt from the rule
-	Oil/Water Separators
	-	If oil is pumped out of the separator into another tank, that tank is considered bulk storage

Vehicle Fueling
-	Must be present during fueling. Do not lock dispenser
-	No "topping off"
-	Report suspect equipment. (Cracked hoses, faulty dispenser, etc.)

Inspections
-	Tanks, Drums, Barrels, Transformers
-	Dike or Berm System
	-	Level of Precipitation
	-	Percent Available Capacity
	-	Operational Status of Drain Valves
	-	Dike or Berm Permeability
	-	Debris
	-	Erosion
-	Secondary Containment
-	Conducted monthly
-	Maintained for at least 5 years
-	Periodic integrity testing (API or STI)
	-	American Petrolum Institute
	-	Steel I
	
-	Leaks
-	Drip marks
-	Discoloration
-	Puddles
-	Corrosion
-	Cracks
-	Localized Dead Vegitation
-	

Spill Response equipment
-	Spill kits
-	Absorbent Pads
-	Booms
-	Occasionally swap out material in the spill kit with new material from storeroom

Spill Response
1.	Source control - stop the leak
2.	Notification
3.	Containment
	-	Stop/slow the flow
	-	Block discharge routes (storm drains)
4.	Zone Control
	-	Hot Zone, decon, PPE
5.	Recovery

# Recycled Water Use

AKA:
-	Reclaimed Water
-	RO Water
-	Reused Water
-	Grey Water
-	R-2 Water

Health Issues:
-	RO water is currently used at many other sites in Hawaii
-	No cases of illness related to recycled water use have been reported
-	RO water is not suitable for drinking

Ingestion of Recycle Water
-	If ingestion occurs, inform the SS and environmental department
-	If it was due to a cross connection contamination, an incident report must be submitted DOH

Hygiene
-	Wash hands before eating, drinking or smoking
-	Wear gloves if contact with recycled water could occur
-	Cover cuts or breaks in the skin
-	Be aware that clothing or tools can transport pathogenic organisms

Food Restrictions
-	Do not eat or store food in areas that coming in contact with recyled water

Training
-	All employees are required to attend an annual training

Posted Notices and Signs
-	Signs that clearly warn that recycled water should not be used to food/drink

Rycycled water usually flows through **purple pipes**, or labels that label the pipe as containing recycled water.

RO Water can only be used as the source water for water treatment systems
At Kahe the RO water can also be used as the backup fire water supply
Ponding of RO water should be prevented to reduce health and vector issues

Restrictions
-	Runoff of RO water
-	Ponding for two hours or more
-	Cross Connection with drinking water lines
-	Hose bib connections

Recycled Water Use Supervisor (RWUS)
The facility SS are designated as the RWUS.

Maintenance and Inspections
-	Check for leaks

Recordkeeping - An annual summary report is due to the DOH (March 1 of the following year)
-	Maintain the Recycled Water Monthly Log to facilitate the completion of the annual report
