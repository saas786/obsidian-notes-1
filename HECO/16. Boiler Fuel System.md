# 16. Boiler Fuel System
---

Crude Oil -> Refinery -> Crude Unit -> Residual
Crude Unit -> Cracker Unit -> Cutter
Residual + Cutter -> Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (LSFO)

## Typical Fuel Tank

## Heating
Fuel Oil Tanks use auxillary steam to preheat fuel oil.

Fuel Oil Heaters use steam from the Reboiler to heat fuel oil.

## Reboiler Condensate Tank
Collects condensate by using steam to heat fuel oil. This is separate from the main condensate tank (to prevent contamination).

## Waiau LSFO & Diesel Tanks
Diesel Tanks 1 & 2
LSFO Tank 1, 3, 4, 5 (2 is OOS)
