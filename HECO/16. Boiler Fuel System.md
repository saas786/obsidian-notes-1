# 16. Boiler Fuel System
---

Crude Oil -> Refinery -> Crude Unit -> Residual
Crude Unit -> Cracker Unit -> Cutter
Residual + Cutter -> Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (LSFO)

## Typical Fuel Tank

## Heating
Fuel Oil Tanks use auxillary steam to preheat fuel oil.

Fuel Oil Heaters use steam from the Reboiler to heat fuel oil.

## Reboiler Condensate Tank
Collects condensate by using steam to heat fuel oil. This is separate from the main condensate tank (to prevent contamination).

## Waiau LSFO & Diesel Tanks
Diesel Tanks 1 & 2
LSFO Tank 1, 3, 4, 5 (2 is OOS)

## Suction (Primary) Fuel Oil (F/O) Heaters & Pumps
Lowers the oil viscosity for ease of transfer from tank to tank or tank to plant. This is achieved with line heating (tracing) which lowers the viscosity of oil in the lines.

## Secondary Fuel Oil (F/O) Heaters & Pumps
Raises temperature and pressure of fuel oil to prepare for [[Glossary#Atomization|atomization]].


## Viscosity
[[Measurements#Viscosity]]

Temperature of fuel oil rises as viscosity drops.

## Typical Burner Assembly
Components:
-	Inner Casing
-	Air foils
-	Diffuser Plate
-	Air Doors
-	Outer Casing
-	Air Door Handle
-	Atomizer Assembly
-	Yoke
-	Safety Shutoff Device Handle

## Burner Front
Atomizing steam and Fuel oil supplied on two lines

## Fuel Firing System
Fuel is fired from four corners of the furnace, at slight angles to induce a swirling motion in the flames.

## Basic Problems
| Problem                                | Probable Causes(s)                                                                                        | Corrected By                                                                                                                                     |

| Flame burning toward burner throat     | Air flow too low, register throttled too much                                                             | Increase air flow, readjust registers                                                                                                            |
| Smoking Flame                          | Coil oil, poor atomization, dirty burner, or insufficient air                                             | Increase oil temperature, clean burner, increase air flow                                                                                        |
