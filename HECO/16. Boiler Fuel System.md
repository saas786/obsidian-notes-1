# 16. Boiler Fuel System
---

Crude Oil -> Refinery -> Crude Unit -> Residual
Crude Unit -> Cracker Unit -> Cutter
Residual + Cutter -> Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (LSFO)

## Typical Fuel Tank

## Heating
Fuel Oil Tanks use auxillary steam to preheat fuel oil.

Fuel Oil Heaters use steam from the Reboiler to heat fuel oil.

## Reboiler Condensate Tank
Collects condensate by using steam to heat fuel oil. This is separate from the main condensate tank (to prevent contamination).

## Waiau LSFO & Diesel Tanks
Diesel Tanks 1 & 2
LSFO Tank 1, 3, 4, 5 (2 is OOS)

## Primary Fuel Oil (F/O) Heaters & Pumps

## Secondary Fuel Oil (F/O) Heaters & Pumps
Raises pressure of fuel oil to prepare for [[Glossary#Atomization|atomization]].

## Viscosity
SSU - Saybolt Universal Seconds, units of viscosity

Temperature of fuel oil rises as viscosity drops.

## Typical Burner Assembly
Components:
-	Inner Casing
-	Air foils
-	Diffuser Plate
-	Air Doors
-	Outer Casing
-	Air Door Handle
-	Atomizer Assembly
-	Yoke
-	Safety Shutoff Device Handle

## Burner Front
Atomizing steam and Fuel oil supplied on two lines

## Fuel Firing System
Fuel is fired from four corners of the furnace, at slight angles to induce a swirling motion in the flames.

## Basic Problems
| Problem                                | Probable Causes(s)                                                                                        | Corrected By                                                                                                                                     |

| Flame separation from burner tip       | Oil too hot, diffuser too close to the tip, or air flow too high                                          | Reduce oil temperature or reduce air flow                                                                                                        |
| Flame burning toward burner throat     | Air flow too low, register throttled too much                                                             | Increase air flow, readjust registers                                                                                                            |
| Smoking Flame                          | Coil oil, poor atomization, dirty burner, or insufficient air                                             | Increase oil temperature, clean burner, increase air flow                                                                                        |
| Formation of clinkers (carbon buildup) | Dirty burner, loose tip, burner retraction out of adjustment, cold oil, or incorrect air register setting | Clean burner, check tip for tightness and tighten as needed, readjust retraction, increase oil temperature, or check and adjust register setting |
| Fire flies or sparklers                | Oil too hot or too much iar                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                  |
1.	Flame separation from burner tip
	-	Probable Cause(s): Oil too hot, diffuser too close to the tip, or air flow too high
	-	Corrected by: Reduce
-	Flame burning toward burner throat
3.	Smoking Flame
4.	Formation of clinkers (carbon buildup)
5.	Fire flies or sparklers
