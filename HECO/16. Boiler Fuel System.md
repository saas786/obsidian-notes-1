# 16. Boiler Fuel System
---

Crude Oil -> Refinery -> Crude Unit -> Residual
Crude Unit -> Cracker Unit -> Cutter
Residual + Cutter -> Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (LSFO)

## Typical Fuel Tank

## Heating
Fuel Oil Tanks use auxillary steam to preheat fuel oil.

Fuel Oil Heaters use steam from the Reboiler to heat fuel oil.

## Reboiler Condensate Tank
Collects condensate by using steam to heat fuel oil. This is separate from the main condensate tank (to prevent contamination).

## Waiau LSFO & Diesel Tanks
Diesel Tanks 1 & 2
LSFO Tank 1, 3, 4, 5 (2 is OOS)

## Primary Fuel Oil (F/O) Heaters & Pumps

## Secondary Fuel Oil (F/O) Heaters & Pumps
Raises pressure of fuel oil to prepare for [[Glossary#Atomization|atomization]].

## Viscosity
SSU - Saybolt Universal Seconds, units of viscosity

Temperature of fuel oil rises as viscosity drops.

## Typical Burner Assembly
Components:
-	Inner Casing
-	Air foils
-	Diffuser Plate
-	Air Doors
-	Outer Casing
-	Air Door Handle
-	Atomizer Assembly
-	Yoke
-	Safety Shutoff Device Handle
