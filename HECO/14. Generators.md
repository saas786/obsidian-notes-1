## Generator Basics
Function:
-	Produce a voltage or potential difference which causes current to flow

Basic Laws:
-	Electric current passing through a coil produces a magnetic field
-	Voltage is induced in a coil if a moving magnetic field passes through it
-	Either the magnet or the coil is moving, the other is stationary
	-	In HECO generators, the coil is stationary and the magnet is moving

__generator__ -- technically a term used for a device that produces DC current
__alternator__ -- a device that produces AC current (what we actually have)

==Major Components:==
-	Stator
-	Rotor
-	Exciter

## Stator
Electrical Circuit
-	Stationary windings in stator core
-	Voltage induced when rotor is spinning
-	Current flows through windings when connected to load

## Rotor
Magnetic Circuit
-	Field intensity varied by DC current input (Exciter)
-	Motion by prime mover (Turbine)

==Basic requirement:== to produce a strong magnetic field

## Exciter / Voltage Regulator

## Hydrogen Cooling & Sealing
-	Major limit to generator capability is the ability to cool the
