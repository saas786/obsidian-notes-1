## Generator Basics
Function:
-	Produce a voltage or potential difference which causes current to flow

Basic Laws:
-	Electric current passing through a coil produces a magnetic field
-	Voltage is induced in a coil if a moving magnetic field passes through it
-	Either the magnet or the coil is moving, the other is stationary
	-	In HECO generators, the coil is stationary and the magnet is moving

__generator__ -- technically a term used for a device that produces DC current
__alternator__ -- a device that produces AC current (what we actually have)

==Major Components:==
-	Stator
-	Rotor
-	Exciter

## Stator
Electrical Circuit
-	Stationary windings in stator core
-	Voltage induced when rotor is spinning
-	Current flows through windings when connected to load

## Rotor
Magnetic Circuit
-	Field intensity varied by DC current input (Exciter)
-	Motion by prime mover (Turbine)

==Basic requirement:== to produce a strong magnetic field

## Exciter / Voltage Regulator

## Watts, VARS, Power Factor
-	Real power (Watts) does work
-	Reactive power (VARS) circulating power, no work produced
-	Apparent power (VA) combined Real and Reactive power

Power Factor:
$$
\frac{\text{Real Power}}{\text{Apparent Power}}

$$

## Hydrogen Cooling & Sealing
-	Major limit to generator capability is the ability to cool the copper

### Hydrogen Gas
Functions:
-	Provide a means for safely putting hydrogen in or taking it out of the machine, using carbon dioxide as a scavenging medium
-	Maintain gas pressure in the machine at the desired value
-	Indicate to the operator at all times, the condition of the machine in regard to gas pressure, temperature and purity. The prescence of water in the machine is also indicated by an alarm on the gas control panel.
