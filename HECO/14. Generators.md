## Generator Basics
Function:
-	Produce a voltage or potential difference which causes current to flow

Basic Laws:
-	Electric current passing through a coil produces a magnetic field
-	Voltage is induced in a coil if a moving magnetic field passes through it
-	Either the magnet or the coil is moving, the other is stationary
	-	In HECO generators, the coil is stationary and the magnet is moving

__generator__ -- technically a term used for a device that produces DC current
__alternator__ -- a device that produces AC current (what we actually have)

==Major Components:==
-	Stator
-	Rotor
-	Exciter

## Stator
Electrical Circuit
-	Stationary windings in stator core
-	Voltage induced when rotor is spinning
-	Current flows through windings when connected to load

Core:
-	Iron core comprised of thousands of thin pie shaped segments (laminations)
-	Slots to support winding

Winding:
-	Conductors insulated together in bars
-	Connected to form 3 phases
-	Secured in slots with wedges
-	11,000 VAC

## Rotor
Magnetic Circuit
-	Field intensity varied by DC current input (Exciter)
-	Motion by prime mover (Turbine)

==Basic requirement:== to produce a strong magnetic field

## Exciter / Voltage Regulator

## Watts, VARS, Power Factor
-	Real power (Watts) does work
-	Reactive power (VARS) circulating power, no work produced
-	Apparent power (VA) combined Real and Reactive power

Power Factor:
$$
\frac{\text{Real Power}}{\text{Apparent Power}}

$$

## Hydrogen Cooling & Sealing
-	Major limit to generator capability is the ability to cool the copper

### Hydrogen Gas
Functions:
-	==Provide a means for safely putting hydrogen in or taking it out of the machine==, using carbon dioxide as a scavenging medium
-	==Maintain gas pressure in the machine at the desired value==
-	==Indicate to the operator at all times, the condition of the machine in regard to gas pressure, temperature and purity==. The prescence of water in the machine is also indicated by an alarm on the gas control panel.
-	==Dry the gas and remove any water vapor== which may get into the machine from the seal oil.

Advantages of using hydrogen gas:
	1.	==Reduced windage and ventilating losses== because of the low density of the hydrogen gas
	2.	==Increased output per unit volume of active material== because of the high thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients of hydrogen. This advantage of hydrogen cooling makes it possible to build turbine generators for higher ratings than are possible with air cooling
	3.	==Reduced maintenence expense== because of the freedom from dirt and moisture
	4.	==Increased life of the insulation of the stator winding== because of the absense of oxygen and moisture
	5.	==Reduced windage noise== because of the low density of the gas
	
### Gland Oil System
Functions:
-	Provide oil under pressure to the seals as free as possible from air and moisture

### Seal Oil System
Functions:
-	Minimizes the need to exhaust & replenish the hydrogen gas
-	Helps remove a large part of the absorbed gas and moisture from the oil before it is pumped back to the seals

Main components:
1.	Defoaming tanks
2.	Vacuum tank
3.	Oil pumps
4.	Vacuum pump and Separator tank
5.	Generator bearing drain loop seal

Hydrogen gas may cycle through the system ==30 or more times per minute==.
