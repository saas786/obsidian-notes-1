## Generator Basics
Function:
-	Produce a voltage or potential difference which causes current to flow

Basic Laws:
-	Electric current passing through a coil produces a magnetic field
-	Voltage is induced in a coil if a moving magnetic field passes through it
-	Either the magnet or the coil is moving, the other is stationary
	-	In HECO generators, the coil is stationary and the magnet is moving

__generator__ -- technically a term used for a device that produces DC current
__alternator__ -- a device that produces AC current (what we actually have)

==Major Components:==
-	Stator
-	Rotor
-	Exciter

## Stator
Electrical Circuit
-	Stationary windings in stator core
-	Voltage induced when rotor is spinning
-	Current flows through windings when connected to load

## Rotor
Magnetic Circuit
-	Field intensity varied by DC current input (Exciter)
-	Motion by prime mover (Turbine)

==Basic requirement:== to produce a strong magnetic field

## Exciter / Voltage Regulator

## Watts, VARS, Power Factor
-	Real power (Watts) does work
-	Reactive power (VARS) circulating power, no work produced
-	Apparent power (VA) combined Real and Reactive power

Power Factor:
$$
\frac{\text{Real Power}}{\text{Apparent Power}}

$$

## Hydrogen Cooling & Sealing
-	Major limit to generator capability is the ability to cool the copper

### Hydrogen Gas
Functions:
-	Provide a means for safely putting hydrogen in or taking it out of the machine, using carbon dioxide as a scavenging medium
-	Maintain gas pressure in the machine at the desired value
-	Indicate to the operator at all times, the condition of the machine in regard to gas pressure, temperature and purity. The prescence of water in the machine is also indicated by an alarm on the gas control panel.

Advantages of using hydrogen gas:
	1.	==Reduced windage and ventilating losses== because of the low density of the hydrogen gas
	2.	==Increased output per unit volume of active material== because of the high thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients of hydrogen. This advantage of hydrogen cooling makes it possible to build turbine generators for higher ratings than are possible with air cooling
	3.	==Reduced maintenence expense== because of the freedom from dirt and moisture
	4.	==Increased life of the insulation of the stator winding== because of the absense of oxygen and moisture
	5.	====Reduced windage noise because of the low density of the gas

## Study Question Answers
1.	produce a voltage or potential difference which causes current to flow
2.	current; electric field
3.	stator; rotor; exciter
4.	all of these
5.	to produce a strong magnetic field
6.	-
	1.	reduced windage and ventilating losses
	2.	increased output per unit volume of active material
	3.	reduced maintenence expense
	4.	increased life of the insulation of the stator winding
	5.	reduced windage noise
7.	hydrogen gas moves through the generator in a gas-tight ventilating system. it goes through the machine to pick up heat, through tube coolers where heat is transferred to auxillary cooling water, then through rotor fans to repeat the cycle.
