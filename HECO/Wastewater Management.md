Section 24
Speaker: Laurie Oishi

Clean Water Act (1972):
-	[[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES)
-	[[Spill Prevention]] (SPCC)
-	[[Storm Water Discharge]]
-	Oil Pollution Act (OPA)

Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) (1976):
-	Provides guidelines on how to handle, transport, store and dispose of hazardous wastes
-	Waste minimization

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund Act):
-	Tells us how to handle the actual clean up and disposal of hazardous waste

HECO complies 100% with any and all environmental laws
-	It can be very costly to comply with these laws, but HECO is 100% commited
-	It may take longer to complete tasks, but HECO is 100% commited
-	Bottom Line -- IT IS A PART OF DOING BUSINESS

## Plant Waste Management at HECO:
-	HECO was required to classify all its waste streams in order to obtain a permit
	-	The Code of Federal Regulations
-	Requirements of Permit
	-	Includes daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual testing and/or inspections
	-	Permit renewals

## Plant Waste Permit Requirements

| Period        | Test                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily         | continuous temp & flow monitoring <br> (Kahe: intermittent monitoring)                            |
| Weekly        | total risidual oxidants                                       |
| Monthly       | discharge monitoring                                          |
| Quarterly     | Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing (WETT) <br> Zone of Mixing (ZOM) |
| Semi-Annually | calibration of monitoring equipment                           |
| Annually      | marine bottom community, stormwater, review & revision of plans and best practices, chemical usage                                                              |

## Plant Solid Waste
Hazardous Waste
-	arrange for proper handling, storage and disposal
-	expensive
-	e.g. halogenated and cleaning solvents, aerosol cans

Non-hazardous Waste
-	arrange for disposal at a local landfill
-	e.g. MCW sludge, boiler fireside ash, stack ash, air preheater washing

## Wastewater Classifications
1.	**Low Volume Waste (LVW)**
Does not exceed limits of NPDES permit.
2.	**Metal Cleaning Waste (MCW)**
Contains item in quantities that exceeds limits of NPDES permit or items found in the Code of Federal Regulations.

### Low Volume Waste
-	Waste that has been previously classified as LVW
-	Does not exceed the limits as established on NPDES permit
-	Does not contain items found in the Code of Federal Regulations
-	Most common type found in our plants
-	Examples: boiler blowdown, condensate reject water, RO reject water, laboratory and sampling streams, floor drains

Limitations: ![[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System#^lvw-limits]]

### Metal Cleaning Waste
-	Waste that has been previously classified as MCW
-	Contains item(s) either exceeding the limits of our NPDES permit or is listed on Code of Federal Regulatoins
-	Waste cannot be discharged from the plant unless it receives further treatment to render it below NPDES limits
-	Examples: boiler fireside washings, boiler chemical cleanings, air preheater cleanings

## Wastewater Treatment Process
-	Wastewater channeled to sump or pit
-	Pumped to
	-	mixing tank (Waiau)
	-	batch tank (Kahe)
-	Checked for specs (pH)

### LVW Handling and Treatment
-	Align LVW to proper area or tank
	-	check and adjust pH to specifications
	-	discharge from plant
-	Waiau - pH adjustment tank
	-	continuous reading via pH probe
-	Kahe - holding ponds
	-	test pH, adjust by mixing chemicals
	
### MCW Handling and Treatment
-	Designate a tank for collection
-	Flocculation and settling of solids
	-	adjust pH using Caustic (NaOH)
		-	pH = 10.5 - 11.0
	-	add polymer (powder) - sediments attract to each other and form clumps, shorten settling time
	-	Waiau - remove the sludge, neutralize liquid in tank using acid ($H_2SO_4$) [6.0-9.0 pH]
	-	Kahe - transfer to pond
	-	Sample for Verification or Lab Approval
		-	discharge if OK
		-	allow to settle longer
		-	retreat if necessary
		
Atmospheric Blowoff Tank
-	vessel that stores blowdowns from boiler or heat exchangers
-	discharges steam to atmosphere
-	used during startup to control pressure

Oil Interceptor / Oil-Water Separators (Oily Sump):
-	wait for oil to settle on top, then clean out with absorbant pads
-	prevents contamination of bodies of water adjacent to the power plant
-	oil contaminated runoff collected in floor drains throughout plant and drains to a sump equipped with an oil-water separator

Alarms:
-	High temperature discharge
-	High/Low pH Levels
-	Low Flow
-	Low air pressure
-	No carrier water
-	High tank level
