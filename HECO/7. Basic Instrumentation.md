# Instrument Data Sheet

# Pressure Measurements
-	pressure gauges
-	transducer - transmit measurements to remote location (control room)

# Temperature Measurements
-	units: Centigrade or Fahrenheit
-	known liquid in glass thermometers (mercury or alcohol)
	-	liquid expands/contracts based on temperature
-	dial thermometers
-	thermocouple (TC)
	-	measures temperature based on voltage between two metals
	-	type J (iron - constantan) (used here)
	-	type K (chromel - alumel)
	-	fast read time (fractions of a second)
	-	remote locations
	-	requires a reference temperature (0 $\degree$C)
	-	aging can change the voltage due to high temperatures or corrosion
	-	drift due to gradient temperatures (metals should be changed out/recalibrated)
	-	consists of two wire legs made from dissimilar wires
-	resistance temperature detector (RTD)
	-	measures temperature based on changes to resistance in a metal
	-	pure platinum, nickel, or copper
	-	requires a power source
	-	2.5 - 10s read time
-	infrared thermometer
	-	spot or camera
	-	surface only
	-	emissivity effects
	-	can have +/- 4F error

# Level Measurements
-	Gauge glass
	-	visual
	-	most common
-	Bubbler tubes
	-	placed in inaccessible areas (e.g. underground pipes)
	-	water column
-	Float level
