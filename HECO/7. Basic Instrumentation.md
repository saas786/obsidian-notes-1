## Instrument Data Sheet

## Pressure Measurements
-	units: psi, inHg (inches of mercury) or inches of water

### Pressure Gauge
Measures the difference between atmospheric pressure and pressure within a pipe or vessel (units: psig).

- Requires periodic calibration
- Can be damaged by exceeding the maximum scale reading (overpressure)

### Manometer
Measured pressure is balanced against the weight of a column of liquid.
-	usually mercury (units: inches of mercury) or water (units: inches of water)
	
### Transducer
Converts temperature, pressure, flow, or position to an electrical signal to be sent to a remote location (control room).

## Temperature Measurements
-	units: Centigrade or Fahrenheit

### Liquid in Glass Thermometer
-	known liquid in glass thermometers (mercury or alcohol)
	-	liquid expands/contracts based on temperature
	
### Dial Thermometer
Measures temperature that is indicated on a round face similar to pressure gauges.

- locally mounted -- devices mounted directly on the point of measurement
- remotely mounted -- devices mounted some distance away from the point of measurement

#### Bimetallic Strip
A locally mounted dial thermometer.
- Operates on the principle of bimetallic strips

#### Capillary Tube Temperature Devices
A remote mounted dial thermometer.
- Operates on the principle of fluid expansion

### Thermocouple (TC)
-	reasons for use:
	-	wide temperature range
	-	fast response time (fractions of a second)
	-	accurate
	-	inexpensive
-	consists of two wire legs made from dissimilar wires
-	directly measures temperature based on voltage between two metals
-	can transmit measurements to remote location

-	different wires used:
	-	type J -- iron-constantan (used here)
	-	type K -- chromel-alumel
	-	copper-constantan
	
-	requires a reference temperature (0 $\degree$C)
-	aging can change the voltage due to high temperatures or corrosion
-	drift due to gradient temperatures (metals should be changed out/recalibrated)
	
### Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD)
-	measures temperature based on changes to resistance in a metal
-	pure platinum, nickel, or copper
-	requires a power source
-	2.5 - 10s read time
	
### Other types
-	infrared thermometer
	-	spot or camera
	-	surface only
	-	emissivity effects
	-	can have +/- 4F error

## Level Measurements
Devices that are used to ==measure the liquid level in a closed vessel==. Vessels may contain very high pressures or under considerable vacuum, requiring different types of level measuring devices.

### Gauge Glass
-	most common
-	placed at the top and bottom of a vessel
-	visual indicator that changes directly with the level inside the vessel
-	used for any type of service

### Float Operated Level Indicator
-	placed on large storage tanks where gauge glasses are impractical
-	float placed inside vessel
-	wire (or steel tape for more accurate measurements) and pulley setup attaches float to an indicator outside the vessel
-	magnetic
-	used on lube oil, raw water, and distilled water storage tanks

### Bubbler Tubes
-	placed in inaccessible areas (e.g. underground pipes)
-	water column

### Head Meter (or Level Meter)
-	used where accuracy is needed over a small range of level
-	usually transmits a signal to a remote recorder (for control purposes)
-	used on the boiler drum, hotwell, and deaerator.


### Other types
-	Radar or Microwave
	-	obstructions
	-	false readings
-	Hydrostatic Level
	-	water column
	-	fragile - sensor can damage easily
-	Differential Pressure Level
	-	measurement is indirect


## Flow Measurement

Two types:
1. **rate meters** -- continuous indication of flow rate
2. **quantity meters** -- total quantity of fluid passing through the meter during some time interval

-	paddle wheel or sight class
	-	visual
	-	paddle spins if there is flow
	
-	Venturi effect / orifice plate
	-	measures pressure and velocity in two different sections of pipe
	
-	ultrasonic flow measurement
	-	turbidity / suspended solids -- less accurate
	-	pip wall shape and reflection
		-	if wall is corroded -- less accurate
	-	laminar flow -- friction from the pipe as the water flows through it
		-	affects accuracy
		
-	mass flow
	-	Coriolis effect
	-	dependent on fluid density
	-	tube rigidity and condition
	
## Recorders
-	located in control room
-	tracks pressure / flow / temperature / level of devices that transmit signals (pneumatic or electrical) to the recorder
-	data logging and trending
-	for safety, any signals should be low pressure or low voltage

## Controllers
Used to ==automatically control pressure, temperature, level, or flow== based on some measured value from a sensor.
e.g. valve positioner

## Switches
Used
-	alarms
-	start / stop equipment
