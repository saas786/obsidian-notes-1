# Instrument Data Sheet

# Pressure Measurements
-	pressure gauges
-	transducer - transmit measurements to remote location (control room)

# Temperature Measurements
-	units: Centigrade or Fahrenheit
-	known liquid in glass thermometers (mercury or alcohol)
	-	liquid expands/contracts based on temperature
-	dial thermometers
-	thermocouple (TC)
	-	measures temperature based on voltage between two metals
	-	type J (iron - constantan) (used here)
	-	type K (chromel - alumel)
	-	fast read time
	-	remote locations
	-	requires a reference temperature (0 $\degree$C)
	-	aging can change the voltage due to high temperatures or corrosion
	-	drift due to gradient temperatures (metals should be changed out/recalibrated)
	-	consists of two wire legs made from dissimilar wires
-	resistance temperature detector (RTD)
	-	measures temperature based on changes to resistance in a metal
	-	pure platinum, nickel
