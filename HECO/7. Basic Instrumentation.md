## Instrument Data Sheet

## Pressure Measurements
-	units: psi, inHg (inches of mercury) or inches of water

-	pressure gauges

-	**manometer** -- measured pressure is balanced against the weight of a column of liquid
	-	usually mercury or water
	
-	**transducer** -- transmit measurements to remote location (control room)

## Temperature Measurements
-	units: Centigrade or Fahrenheit
-	known liquid in glass thermometers (mercury or alcohol)
	-	liquid expands/contracts based on temperature
	
-	dial thermometers

-	thermocouple (TC)
	-	reasons for use:
		-	wide temperature range
		-	fast response time
		-	accurate
		-	inexpensive
	-	directly measures temperature based on voltage between two metals
	-	type J (iron - constantan) (used here)
	-	type K (chromel - alumel)
	-	fast read time (fractions of a second)
	-	remote locations
	-	requires a reference temperature (0 $\degree$C)
	-	aging can change the voltage due to high temperatures or corrosion
	-	drift due to gradient temperatures (metals should be changed out/recalibrated)
	-	consists of two wire legs made from dissimilar wires
	
-	resistance temperature detector (RTD)
	-	measures temperature based on changes to resistance in a metal
	-	pure platinum, nickel, or copper
	-	requires a power source
	-	2.5 - 10s read time
	
-	infrared thermometer
	-	spot or camera
	-	surface only
	-	emissivity effects
	-	can have +/- 4F error

## Level Measurements

Two types:
1. rate meters
2. quantity meters

### Gauge glass
-	visual
-	most common

### Bubbler tubes
-	placed in inaccessible areas (e.g. underground pipes)
-	water column

### Float Operated Level Indicator

-	placed on large storage tanks where gauge glasses are impractical
-	tape/wire for tanks
-	magnetic

-	Radar or microwave
	-	obstructions
	-	false readings
-	hydrostatic level
	-	water column
	-	fragile - sensor can damage easily
-	differential pressure level
	-	measurement is indirect
-	level meters
	-	considerable accuracy for small range of level
	-	usually transmits a signal to a remote location

## Flow Measurement
-	paddle wheel or sight class
	-	visual
	-	paddle spins if there is flow
	
-	Venturi effect / orifice plate
	-	measures pressure and velocity in two different sections of pipe
	
-	ultrasonic flow measurement
	-	turbidity / suspended solids -- less accurate
	-	pip wall shape and reflection
		-	if wall is corroded -- less accurate
	-	laminar flow -- friction from the pipe as the water flows through it
		-	affects accuracy
		
-	mass flow
	-	Coriolis effect
	-	dependent on fluid density
	-	tube rigidity and condition
	
## Recorders
-	pressure / flow / temperature / level
-	data logging and trending

## Switches
-	alarms
-	start / stop equipment

## Controllers
e.g. valve positioner
