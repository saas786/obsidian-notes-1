## Auxiliary Cooling Water System
Function:
-	Cools various equipment in the plant
-	Closed loop system
-	Uses chemically treated demineralized water to combat corrosion
-	ACW pumped to equipment
-	Make-up water is supplied from the demineralized water tanks or the condensate system.

Operation:
-	ACW pumps takes suction from the ACW return tank (hot water)
-	Discharges to Chillers (heat exchangers) to be cooled
	-	service water systems provides cooling medium
-	ACW exits from the chiller (cooled water) and enters the plant and branches off to the various equipment requiring cooling
-	Upon exiting the equipment being cooled, the ACW then flows into a return header that discharges back to the ACW return tank
