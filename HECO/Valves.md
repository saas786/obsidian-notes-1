Three (3) categories:
- stop (on-off)
- throttle/control (control flow rate)
- check (prevent flow reversal)

### Stop Valves

Stop valves either allow or disallow flow in either direction. Usually not designed for throttling which can damage the valve.

-	**Gate Valve**
	-	corrosion can damage it if partially open
-	**Plug Valve / Cock Valve**
	-	turns 90$\degree$ to completely close
-	**Ball Valve**
	-	valve seat may be damaged when used partially open

### Throttle/Control Valves

Throttle or Control valves control the flow rate through them.

-	**Globe Valve**
	-	less damage to the valve seat / valve plug
	-	closing it too far can damage the valve and valve seat
-	**Butterfly**
	-	used in low pressure systems

### Check Valves

-	**Check Valve**
	-	uses a flap inside the valve on a hinge to prevent reverse flow
	-	flow direction marked on outside of valve (unless covered with insulation)
	
Check valves are typically placed only at the discharge end of pumps, which can be used to identify which sides are the discharge and suction.

### Steam Traps
Prevents steam from flowing while allowing condensate to flow.
-	operates by difference in temperature
-	closes when hot steam is detected in pipe
-	used to collect condensate

### Diaphragm Operated Control Valves
Two (2) types:
-	single seated valve
-	double seated valve
	
### Actuators
Actuators automatically control valves.

-	Diaphragm Actuator
	-	operates
-	Solenoid Actuator
	-	a **solenoid** is an electronically powered:
		-	a wire coil
		-	a spring
		-	an armature or core
		-	a stem
	-	opens/closes a valve
### Fail Open/Closed
Some control valves contain actuators (ex. diaphragm, hydraulic, or piston actuators) which operate on pressure setpoints that can either "fail open" or "fail closed" by design.

**fail open**: valve opens when air pressure is lost
**fail closed**: valve closes when air pressure is lost

### Valve Operation
Proper use:
-	appropriate service
-	closed correctly

Leaks:
-	symptom of a problem
-	troubleshoot - scale or buildup, debris
	-	open and close the valve in order to break away scale
-	correct the problem
	-	submit a [[notifications|notification]] that describes the problem and depending on problem a work order may be issued to fix it

Positive Shutoff:
-	2 valves in series
-	first valve (upstream; closest to the vessel or line) is the positive shutoff valve
-	second valve is a "sacrificial" valve that is operated while first valve is opened wide
-	any wear will take place on the second valve

Large Gate Valves:
-	may be difficult to open due to high difference in pressure
-	equalizing lines
	-	second valve that bypasses main valve in order to equalize pressure on both sides
