## Auxiliary Steam System
Function:
-	Provides low pressure saturated steam for heating, cleaning, cooling, sealing, and atomizing
-	Provides backup steam supply for other systems
-	Sources:
	-	boiler drum/steam drum
	-	main steam
	
From boiler drum:
-	saturation temperature
-	straight reducing
-	supplies to:
	-	steam air heaters
	-	oil burner gun purge
	-	cooling steam
	-	reboiler coils

From main steam:
-	superheated temperature
-	desuperheating reducing
-	supplies to:
	-	fuel oil heating (steam tracing)
	-	sealing steam
	-	station heating
	-	turbine driven or reciprocating pumps
