## Auxiliary Steam System
Function:
-	Provides low pressure saturated steam for heating, cleaning, cooling, sealing, and atomizing
-	Provides backup steam supply for other systems
-	Sources:
	-	boiler drum/steam drum
	-	main steam
	
From boiler drum:
-	saturation temperature
-	straight reducing
-	supplies to:
	-	steam air heaters
	-	oil burner gun purge
	-	cooling steam
	-	reboiler coils

From main steam:
-	superheated temperature
-	desuperheating reducing
-	supplies to:
	-	fuel oil heating (steam tracing)
	-	sealing steam
	-	station heating
	-	turbine driven or reciprocating pumps
	
Properties:
-	Pressure -> about 330 psig at K12, 200 psig at W34

Recipients:
-	Steam air heaters (combustion air)
-	Scavenging steam for oil burner gun purge
-	Fuel oil burners
	-	atomizing steam
	-	cooling steam for burner guns
-	Reboiler steam coils
-	Fuel oil heating (steam tracers)
-	Steam for turbine driven or reciprocating pumps
-	Sealing steam (turbine)
	
### Miscellanous Drip Collection

Equipment producing drips:
-	reboilers in FO heater steam
-	air ejector - inter and after condensers
-	steam air heaters
-	feedwater and steam sampling stations
-	steam traps

Drips are collected in drip pot or drain tank

### Gland Seal Water
Function:
-	seals pumps' shafts to prevent air leakage into the pump
-	lubricates and cools the pump packing

Water supply:
-	Demineralized/distilled or condensate
-	Stored in Gland Seal Head tank

Seal Head Tanks
-	Usually located on higher floors
-	nitrogen blanket - keeps tanks free of air
-	gravity flows to pumps

Used water is returned to condensor hotwell

Seals turbine shaft from casing
-	steam, water, or a combination
-	low pressure turbine glands

Equipment using seal water:
-	Condensate pumps
-	#3 or #4 heater drip pump
-	Reboiler feed pumps
-	Water-sealed valves

Location -> Upper floors at K12
Water Pressure -> 20 psig
