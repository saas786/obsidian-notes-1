# Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)
-	ensures the water quality of the facility's runoff
-	identifies potential sources of pollution
-	includes Best Management Practices (BMP)

BMP
-	if it can be picked up and thrown away, do so
-	if it can be swept up, sweep it up
-	if you cannot the impact of your activity, at least minimize it
-	doing something is better than nothing, just do it right

BMPs for Waste Storage Areas
-	Close dumpster lids when not in use
-	Periodically inspect the condition of the dumpster
-	Sweep area surrounding the bins
-	Store under overhangs
-	Construct berms around area

BMPs for Painting, Sandblasting, or Grinding
-	Use tarps to cover ground
-	Sweep up dust, sand, and paint chips daily, at a minimum
-	Enclose blast area with tarps or plastic sheeting
-	Leaving waste material on the ground is unacceptable
-	Paint on asphalt -> use asphalt coating

Storm Water Accumulated in Berms
-	Obtain supervisor approval to discharge
-	Only discharge clean storm water
-	Record draining activity on log sheet
-	Close and lock drain after draining activity
	-	or isolate pumps
-	The clean storm water can be discharged to the ground or storm drains

Metals
-	All metal subject to significant corrosion must be stored under cover or indoors
-	Rust scale on the ground is unacceptable
-	Any amount of metal on the ground is too much
-	Building and structures also can contribute to stormwater

Reduce Runoff
-	Allow storm water to infiltrate into the ground
-	Create buffers
-	Slow down the flow

Inspections and Monitoring
-	Facility inspections are required quarterly
	-	Inspection forms certified by Operations Manager
-	Stormwater Monitoring is required quarterly
	-	Rain Gauge, daily rainfall log
	-	Sample within 30 minutes of a discharge

Corrective Actions, <14 days
-	Immediately (i.e. same day) minimize or prevent discharge of pollutant
	-	Something must be done
-	Complete subsequent actions within 14 days if immediate actions are insufficient
	-	Install new BMPs
	-	Repair equipment
	-	Modify BMP
	
Non-Stormwater Discharge
-	Only stormwater runoff is allowed in the facility stormdrains
-	Washing cars is not allowed
-	It doesn't matter how clean the water is either
-	Washwater must be collected
