# 13. Steam Turbines
---

Process of how steam drives the turbine (enthalpy -> kinetic energy):
1.	The nozzle converts the pressure energy of the steam to velocity
2.	The turbine blades exert a force on the steam to change its momentum by changing its velocity
3.	The steam in turn exerts an equal but opposite force on the blades causing them to move and turn the turbine shaft
