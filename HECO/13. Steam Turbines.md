# 13. Steam Turbines
---

Process of how steam drives the turbine (enthalpy -> kinetic energy):
1.	The nozzle converts the pressure energy of the steam to velocity
2.	The turbine blades exert a force on the steam to change its momentum by changing its velocity
3.	The steam in turn exerts an equal but opposite force on the blades causing them to move and turn the turbine shaft

Two types:
-	reaction type
-	impulse type

## Reaction Type Turbine Blades
-	Nozzle is mounted on the wheel. Steam discharging from the nozzle will cause the wheel to rotate in the opposite direction.

Ex. A lawn sprinkler

## Impulse Type Turbine Blades
-	Nozzle is stationary, and discharges against a blade or "bucket" that is mounted on the wheel. Steam discharging from the nozzle will cause the wheel to rotate in that direction.

Ex. Blowing onto a pinwheel

## Compound Turbines

Compound turbine -- a machine in which steam passes in sequence through two or more separate turbine sections
Tandem compound -- an arrangement of turbine sections in line on the same shaft and driving the same generator
Cross compound -- an arrangement of turbine sections on separate shafts and driving separate generators
Reheat turbines -- a machine in which intermediate pressure steam is routed back to the boiler for re-heating, then returned to the intermediate and low pressure turbine sections

Four Fundamental parts of a Steam Turbine:
-	rotor (inside casings)
-	casings
-	nozzles (inside casings) - steam passes through these to hit the rotors
	-	enters at around 1800 pounds of pressure
-	frame or base
