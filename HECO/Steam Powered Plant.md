# Introduction to the Steam Power Plant

Boiling point $\rightarrow 212\degree F$ at normal ATM, sea level

Raise pressure -> lower boiling point

Why steam:
- source of heat and pressure
- convenient & economical (water is everywhere)
- easy to make
- easy to control
- versatile

Dry (saturated) steam:
- colorless vapor
- turns white (wet steam) a short distance from the source

Wet steam:
- white in color
- less heat per pound than dry steam

[[Teapot Theory]]

Waiau:
- 2 combustion turbines

Superheated steam -> Steam boiled at a high enough temperature to become dry.

Measuring pressure -> Steam Tables
- Can find pressure from volume of water/steam, H, U
