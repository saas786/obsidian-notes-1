# Introduction to the Steam Power Plant

Boiling point $\rightarrow 212\degree F$ at normal ATM, sea level

Raise pressure -> lower boiling point

Dry (saturated) steam:
- colorless vapor
- turns white (wet steam) a short distance from the source

Wet steam:
- white in color
- less heat per pound than dry steam
