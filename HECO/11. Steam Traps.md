# 11. Steam Traps
---

Function:
-	let out condensate, hold back steam
-	eliminate air and gas quickly
-	remove condensate, air and gas by responding promptly to changing conditions

Reason for use:
-	when used in the main steam line, prevent damage to the turbine
-	prevent corrosion in the system, due to the mixture of condensate and $CO_{2}$
-	improve heat exchange

Usually located in the main steam line.

Classes:
1.	mechanical - change of stage of fluid
2.	thermostatic - temperature
3.	thermodynamic - thermodynamic energy

## Inverted Bucket
A mechanical steam trap. Steam and condensate flows through the inlet into a bucket. When the bucket is floating, When the bucket is filled with enough condensate, it will sink, pulling the top valve from the seat. This allows the condensate to flow out of the outlet.
