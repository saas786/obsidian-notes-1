# Condensate and Feedwater
- steam enters condenser
- passes through a series a tubes with cooler water passing through it
- condensed water (condensate) is sent to condensate pump

## Components
- hotwell
- condensate pumps
- gland steam condensers
- air ejector condensors
- de-aerator
- hot surge tank
- boiler feed pumps
	- increase the pressure of feedwater until it can pass through the high pressure feedwater heaters
	- variable speed and used for flow control
- high-pressure heater
- feedwater regulating valve

### Booster Pumps
Used to increase the pressure to the suction of the boiler feed pumps.

### Gland Steam Condensers
Used to recover heat from the steam used in the plant's gland steam system.

### Air Ejector Condensers
Used to recover heat from the steam in the main condenser's air removal system.

## Normal Operation

### Lubricating Oil
Can be viewed through a sight glass to check the flow, level, and condition of the lubricant.

If the ==lubicating oil has an unusual color==, this is a sign that ==the oil has been contaminated and should be replaced==.

### Cooling Water
Used to cool the pump's bearings.


### Thermal Temperature Difference (TTD)
a measure of the effectiveness of heat transfer between the steam and feedwater in the feedwater heater

TTD = (saturation temperature of the steam in the heater's condensing section) - (feedwater outlet temperature)


## Operating Problems

### Air Binding
Occurs when air collects in the water boxes on the tube side of the heat, causing the flow of water
