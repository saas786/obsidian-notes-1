# Condensate and Feedwater
- steam enters condenser
- passes through a series a tubes with cooler water passing through it
- condensed water (condensate) is sent to condensate pump

## Condenser System Components
- hotwell
- condensate pumps
- gland steam condensers
- air ejector condensors
- de-aerator
- hot surge tank
- boiler feed pumps
	- increase the pressure of feedwater until it can pass through the high pressure feedwater heaters
	- variable speed and used for flow control
- high-pressure heater
- feedwater regulating valve

As condensate passes through the condensor & feedwater system, its temperature and pressure gradually increase.

### Hotwell
Collects condensate from the main condensor. It provides a supply of water for the condensate pump to pull from.

Level is measured using sight glasses. It is critical to maintain the correct level in the hotwell.

### Condensate Pumps
Used to increase the pressure of the condensate from the hotwell. They are usually constant-speed, multistage, centrifugal pumps.
Usually two or more condensate pumps are used in a condensate & feedwater system, and one or more pumps may be operating at any given time. E.g. if the pumps are 100% capacity pumps, only one needs to be running while the others serve as backups.

### Gland Steam & Air Ejector Condensers
Gland steam condensers are used to recover heat from the steam used in the plant's gland steam system. Uses condensate in order to cool the steam and heat the condensate.

Air ejector condensers are used to recover heat from the steam in the main condenser's air removal system.

These condensors are usually "shell and tube" heat exchangers. These types of condensors consist of a shell, or casing, with a bundle of tubes inside.
__shell side__ -- the area inside the casing but outside the tubes
__tube side__ -- the area inside the tubes

The tube side contains condensate that cools the steam, and the shell side contains steam from the gland steam system or the air ejector system.

### Air Ejector Condensers

### De-aerator
An open or direct contact heater where oxygen and other non-condensable gases are removed from the condensate in order to minimize corrosion in downstream equipment.

This is a direct contact heater because the de-aerator mixes the condensate and extraction steam together, heating the condensate.

### Hot Surge Tank (or Feedwater Storage Tank or De-aerator Storage Tank)
Where condensate is collected after leaving the bottom of the de-aerator. At this point, the condensate can be considered "feedwater".

This tank provides a net positive suction head for the pumps that are connected to it.

### Booster Pumps
Used to increase the pressure to the suction of the boiler feed pumps. They are usually constant-speed, multistage centrifugal pumps, driven be constant speed motors. Not generally used for flow control.

Can be located on the condensor side of the system ("condensate booster pumps") or on the feedwater side ("boiler feed booster pumps").

Not all systems use booster pumps.


## Feedwater System Components

### High-pressure Feedwater Heaters

### Feedwater Regulating Valve
Regulates the flow of feedwater entering the economizer

### Economizer
Used to preheat the feedwater using the combustion gases leaving the boiler.

### Boiler Feed Pumps
Used to increase the pressure of the feedwater. They are variable-speed, multistage centrifugal pumps. Some pumps are driven by steam turbines. The speed of the turbine depends on the amoutn of steam flowing to the turbine. 

## Normal Operation

### Lubricating Oil
Can be viewed through a sight glass to check the flow, level, and condition of the lubricant.

If the ==lubicating oil has an unusual color==, this is a sign that ==the oil has been contaminated and should be replaced==.

### Cooling Water
Used to cool the pump's bearings.


### Thermal Temperature Difference (TTD)
a measure of the effectiveness of heat transfer between the steam and feedwater in the feedwater heater

TTD = (saturation temperature of the steam in the heater's condensing section) - (feedwater outlet temperature)


## Operating Problems

### Air Binding
Occurs when air collects in the water boxes on the tube side of the heat, causing the flow of water through the tubes to be restricted (increases velocity of water).

-	Differential pressure across the feedwater heater could be a sign of air binding.

### Pump Problems
Common causes:
-	Pump trip caused by motor overload, low oil pressure, or breaker trip
-	Manual trip of pump
-	Loss of pump suction, insufficient net positive suction head, or loss of prime
-	Malfunctioning variable-speed coupling (for boiler feed pump)
-	Improper valve lineup

## Topic I: System Layout
Purpose of feedwater & condensate system:
-	to maintain normal operation of a power plant's boiler
-	to ensure the water entering the boiler is equal to the amount of steam leaving the boiler and enters the main steam system
-	to keep the boiler supplied with the proper amount of water
