# Condensate and Feedwater
- steam enters condenser
- passes through a series a tubes with cooler water passing through it
- condensed water (condensate) is sent to condensate pump

## Components
- hotwell
- condensate pumps
- gland steam condensers
- air ejector condensors
- de-aerator
- hot surge tank
- boiler feed pumps
	- increase the pressure of feedwater until it can pass through the high pressure feedwater heaters
	- variable speed and used for flow control
- high-pressure heater
- feedwater regulating valve

### Booster Pumps
Used to increase the pressure to the suction of the boiler feed pumps.

### Gland Steam Condensers
Used to recover heat from the steam used in the plant's gland steam system. Uses condensate in order to cool the steam and heat the condensate.

### Air Ejector Condensers
Used to recover heat from the steam in the main condenser's air removal system.

### De-aerator
An open heater where oxygen and other non-condensable gases are removed from the condensate in order to minimize corrosion in downstream equipment.

### Hot Surge Tank
Where condensate is collected after leaving the de-aerator. At this point, the condensate can be considered "feedwater".

This tank provides a net positive suction head for the pumps that are connected to it.

## Normal Operation

### Lubricating Oil
Can be viewed through a sight glass to check the flow, level, and condition of the lubricant.

If the ==lubicating oil has an unusual color==, this is a sign that ==the oil has been contaminated and should be replaced==.

### Cooling Water
Used to cool the pump's bearings.


### Thermal Temperature Difference (TTD)
a measure of the effectiveness of heat transfer between the steam and feedwater in the feedwater heater

TTD = (saturation temperature of the steam in the heater's condensing section) - (feedwater outlet temperature)


## Operating Problems

### Air Binding
Occurs when air collects in the water boxes on the tube side of the heat, causing the flow of water through the tubes to be restricted (increases velocity of water).

-	Differential pressure across the feedwater heater could be a sign of air binding.

### Pump Problems
Common causes:
-	Pump trip caused by motor overload, low oil pressure, or breaker trip
-	Manual trip of pump
-	Loss of pump suction, insufficient net positive suction head, or loss of prime
-	Malfunctioning variable-speed coupling (for boiler feed pump)
-	Improper valve lineup

## Topic I: System Layout
Purpose of feedwater & condensate system:
-	to maintain normal operation of a power plant's boiler
-	to ensure the water entering the boiler is equal to the amount of steam leaving the boiler and enters the main steam system
-	to keep the boiler supplied with the proper amount of water
