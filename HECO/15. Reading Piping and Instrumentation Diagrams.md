### Civil, Structural & Architectural

### Mechanical

#### Heat Balance Diagrams
Contains information on:
-	theoretical steam temperatures and pressures through turbine and extraction steam systems
-	theoretical FWH inlet & outlet temperatures
-	theoretical FWH drain cooler drips temperatures
-	can help estimate a load that a component may go from pressure to vacuum

### Electrical

#### Electrical System Descriptions

#### Electrical Equipment Data Sheets

#### Electrial System Diagrams
