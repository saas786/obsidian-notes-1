Feeding chemicals to the boiler water keeps the water pure and reduces corrosion in the piping and equipment which extends the life of the equipment.

-	protecting the turbine
	-	by producing clean steam
		-	by keeping water chemistry within parameters
		
Chemicals:
-	Hydrazine ($\ce{N2H4}$): eliminates any dissolved oxygen in the condensate by reacting with the oxygen to create $\ce{H2O}$ or $\ce{H3O}$
-	Ammonia: controls pH of condensate in order to reduce corrosion in pipes (10-12 pH)
	-	primarily used in piping systems made of steel
	-	will corrode brass piping by dissolving the copper
-	Sodium Hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$): breaks down sludge in boiler dru

**Action Level** - represents the control parameters at critical sample points. The higher the action level, the greater the need is to perform corrective action to control the chemistry of the water.
-	NORMAL
-	ACTION LEVEL 1
-	ACTION LEVEL 2
-	ACTION LEVEL 3
-	IMMEDIATE SHUTDOWN


Priorities:
1.	Personal Safety
2.	Environmental Issues
3.	Equipment Safety & Preservation
