## Water Side
![[Pasted image 20211115084231.png]]

- feedwater is sent from the steam drum and boiled through a series of pipes in the boiler
- heated water then sent back into the steam drum
- in the steam drum, the steam and water separate
	- steam is sent through the top of the tank and passes through the primary superheater and secondary superheater
	- water is pushed down due to the difference in pressure (establishes natural circulation)
-	
	
## Natural Circulation
- affected by:
	- height (fixed by design)
	- operating pressure (controllable)
	- heat rate (controllable)
	- friction losses

- turbulent flow (good mixing)
	- good heat transfer
	- rapid movement / flow
	
- laminar flow (layered / poor mixing)
	- poor heat transfer
	- slow movement / flow
	
- nucleate boiling (desired)
- film boiling (not desired)

### Secondary Superheater (SSH)
- positioned at hottest point in the furnace
- achieves design superheat temperature

### Reheat Unit (RH)
- increases temperature of steam from the turbines
- handles steam at much lower pressures

### Primary Superheater (PSH)
- increases temperature
- starts superheat process

### Economizer
- positioned at coolest point in the furnace
- preheats feedwater

### Steam Drum
cyclone steam separator - spins the steam so all the moisture collects on the outside of the scrubber
scrubber - series of metal sheets where steam can easily pass through but water cannot

## Fire Side

conduction -- occurs in all heat exchangers across the metal of the tube walls
convection -- occurs mainly in SSH, RH, PSH, economizer, air preheater (APH)
radiation -- occurs mainly in waterwalls and lower part of SSH

### Conduction
factors affecting transfer:
1. temperature difference
2. surface area
3. efficiency of material

### Convection
factors affecting transfer:
1. temperature difference
2. specific heat capacity
3. mass flow rate

### Radiation
factors affecting transfer:
1. temperature difference
2. area in line of sight
3. ability to absorb or reflect

### Forced Draft Fan
- takes air from the atmosphere through ducts, to a windbox surrounding the furnace
- high and low speed motor (control speed of air)

### Balanced Draft System
- usually operates at negative pressure

### Induced Draft Fan
- used to send flue gasses (gasses from combustion) to the stack

### Furnace Windbox

### Insertable Kinetic (IK)
-	sootblowers
-	long retractable sootblower
-	fixed rotary sootblower
-	air pre-heater (APH)
	-	horizontal or vertical (direction of air flow)
	-	stationary
	-	heat transfer occurs from the flue gas (more heat recovered)
	-	baskets containing corrugated sheet metal absorb the flue gas

1. energy conversion
2. waterside; water and/or steam; fireside; combustion; flue
3. overheat of the boiler tubes due to lack of heat transfer from the circulation
4. height of the unit; operating pressure; heat rate; friction losses
5. heat input rate; operating pressure
6. height of the unit; friction losses
