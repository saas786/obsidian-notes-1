- feedwater is boiled through a series of pipes in the boiler, then sent back into the feedwater tank
- in the feedwater tank, the steam and water separate
	- steam is sent through the top of the tank
	- water is pushed down due to the difference in pressure (establishes natural circulation)
	
## Natural Circulation
- affected by:
	- height (fixed by design)
	- operating pressure (controllable)
	- heat rate (controllable)
	- friction losses

- turbulent flow (good mixing)
	- good
