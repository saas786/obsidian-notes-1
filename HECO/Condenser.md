### Condenser
==Two (2) main functions:==
-	Creates a vacuum or low absolute pressure at turbine exhaust
-	Reclaims and collects high purity condensate for reuse in the cycle

Steam from the turbine flows through the shell side.
Circulating water flows through the tube side.
Condensate is stored in the hotwell.

The condenser may expand/contract as the temperature changes, so it is usually held by springs or is hung from supports.

A 2-pass [[Shell and Tube Heater]].

### Main Condenser
The main condenser is ==located below the turbine exhaust==, which minimizes the pressure drop.

It is fitted with expansion joints and spring mounts to allow for the condenser to expand in response to the temperature changes.

#### Circulating Water (CW) Side
-	Most are single pass
-	CW enters the inlet waterbox, flows through the tubes to the outlet waterbox, and then overboard.
-	CW side is divided in halves so one side can be isolated while unit is online
	-	cleaning, maintenence, check for tube leaks

#### Steam Side
-	Must be leak tight to prevent loss of vacuum
-	Steam enters from the top of the condenser
-	Tube layout must be such that the steam can quickly and easily come into contact with greatest number of tubes

### Air Removal Zone
-	Air and non-condensable gases are present in the condenser
