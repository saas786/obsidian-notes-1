Pressure: the force acting on a unit of area
- units: psi (pounds per square inch)

1 atm (atmospheric pressure) = 14.7 psi at sea level

psig (Gauge pressure): Pressure measurements using 14.7 psi as zero

psia (Absolute pressure): Pressure measurements using 0 psi (vaccum) as zero

Partial vacuum -> less than 14.7 psi (less than atmospheric pressure)

Three types of fluid in water
1. liquid (incompressible)
2. gas (compressible)
3. vapor (compressible)
