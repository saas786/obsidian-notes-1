## Pressure
the force acting on a unit of area
- units: PSI (pounds per square inch)

__atmospheric pressure__ (1 atm) = 14.7 psi at sea level
__vacuum__ = 0 psi

__gauge pressure__ (PSIG): Pressure measurements using 14.7 psi (atmospheric pressure) as zero
__absolute pressure__ (PSIA): Pressure measurements using 0 psi (vaccum) as zero
__partial vacuum__: less than 14.7 psi (less than atmospheric pressure)

$$
0 PSIG &=  14.7 PSIA \\
100 PSIA &= 114.7 PSIG \\
-14.7 PSIG &=     0 PSIA

Three types of fluid in water
1. liquid (incompressible)
2. gas (compressible)
3. vapor (compressible)
