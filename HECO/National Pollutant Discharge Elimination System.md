Industrial Waste Water Discharge Permit

NPDES Program
-	The Clean water act prohibits anybody from discharging pollutants via a point source (i.e. pip, ditch, container, tunnel) into waters of the US without a permit
-	The NPDES program address water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants

Only discharges listed in the facility's permit are allowed
These discharges are limited to:
-	Condenser cooling water
-	Low volume waste
	-	ex. boiler water (distilled water w/ chemicals)
-	Metal cleaning waste
	-	ex. chemically treated water used to clean furnace walls
-	Chlorine (Kahe and Waiau only)
-	Stormwater Runoff
All other discharges are prohibited

Prohibited Discharges
-	Wastestreams generated at other facilities
	-	Ex. Cannot discharge Kahe's wastewater at Waiau or vice versa
-	Wastestreams specifically prohibited:
	-	PCB transformer fluid
	-	closed loop system compounds (e.g. ACW)
	
Cooling Water Limits

| Parameter   | Discharge Limit                                     | Monitoring Frequency |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Flow        | Based on capacity of cooling water pumps            | Continuous           |
| Temperature | Waiau - 102 F, Kahe - $\Delta$ 15 F (15 F higher than intake), Kahului - 90 F | Continuous           |

Low Volume Waste Limits

| Paramter                     | Discharge Limit                                          | Monitoring Frequency |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Flow                         | Waiau - 0.350 MGD, Kahe - 0.270 MGD, Kahului - 0.040 MGD | Continuous           |
| Total Suspended Solids (TSS) | 30 mg/L Monthly average, 100 mg/L - Daily max            | Once/Month           |
| Oil & Grease (O&G)           | 15 mg/L - Monthly average, 20 mg/L - Daily max           | Once/Month           |
| Total Copper & Total Iron    | 1.0 mg/L - Daily Max                                     | Once/Month           |
| pH                           | Between 6.0 and 9.0 SU                                   | Once/Month           |

LVW/MCW Sampling
-	Sample must be "representative" of the tank or pond
-	Must sample every month there is a discharge
-	Sample should be collected in the first week of each month in case there are any issues, there is time to re-sample or make adjustments

Condensate (Hotwell) Discharges
-	Condensate is considered LVW
-	Discharges straight to cooling water tunnels, not the wastewater treatment
-	Typically discharged during start-ups and salt leaks
-	Condensate must be monitored during every discharge
-	If hotwell is re-routed to waste water treatment system, monitoring is not necessary

Chlorine Dioxide System
-	Minimize biofouling of the cooling water system
-	Only permitted at Waiau and Kahe
-	CLO2 systems can only operate:
	-	Two hours per unit per day
	-	One unit dosing at any given time
	-	System rinse cycle not included

Cooling Water System Requirements
-	2019 requirement to inspect and operate the cooling water system
-	Weekly inspection of:
	-	Intake bar racks
	-	Traveling screens
	-	Cooling water tunnels
-	Properly maintain equipment (heat exhangers, pumps, piping)
-	Only operate unit necessary for power generation

Monitoring
-	Effluent Monitoring - end of pipe
-	Zone of Mixing (ZOM)
	-	Samples are collected from the recveing water to determine the impact of the discharge on the ocean
-	Whole Effluent Toxicity Test (WETT)
	-	Live animals (shrimp or sea urchins) are used to test the toxicity of the discharge
	
Recordkeeping
-	Discharge Monitoring Reports
-	ZOM and WETT reports
-	Equipment Calibration Logs
	-	pH Meters
	-	Temperature Probes
	-	Flow Meters
	
Calibration
-	pH Meters (+- 0.05 SU)
	-	Tabletop, daily (when used)
	-	Inline, quarterly
	-	pH Buffers must be current
-	Temperature Probes (+- 1F)
	-	Quarterly
	-	Meter used for calibration must be certified
-	Flow Meters (+- 10%)
	-	Every 180 days
	-	Internal practice (HECO) is to change out meters quarterly

DOH/EPA Enforcement
-	Each violation of the permit is subject to a maximum fine of $37,500 per day
-	Sample things such as not calibrating a pH meter as required can add up to thousands of dollars in fines
-	Honolulu and Waiau paid fines totalling $200,000 for what was thought to be minor violations

Typical DOH/EPA Findings
-	Poor Housekeeping (sediment, metal shavings, trash & debris)
-	Active oil leaks from vehicles and equipment
-	Storm water exceedance (copper and pH)
