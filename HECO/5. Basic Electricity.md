#electricity

atoms -> made up of neutrons, protons, and electrons
__protons__ -> positively charged particle
__electrons__ -> negatively charged particles
__neutrons__ -> 0 charge particles

__electricity__ -> the movement of electrons through a conductor

Common conductors: Copper (Cu) (common in housing), Aluminum (Al) (common in transmission), Silver (expensive), Brass, Steel alloys

Good conductors:
- metals
- easily allows movement of electrons

Bad conductors (ex. Fluorine (F)):
- non-metals

## Voltage
units: V (volts) = J/C (Joules per coulomb)
measure of potential difference between two points

## Ampere
units: A (amps) = C/s (coulombs per second)
measures rate of flow of electrons

## Resistance
units: $\Omega$ (ohms)
measures electrical resistance

relation -> it takes 1V to force 1V

## Two basic laws of electricity
1. in order to have electron flow, there must be a difference in potential ($A>0$ only if $V>0$)
2. the current in any electrical circuit is directly proportional to the difference in potential (as $V\uparrow$, $A\uparrow$)

__electrical grid__ 

## Cells
A __cell__ is a material which electrodes can be eaten away during a chemical action (_primary cell_) or a material which electrodes and solution are altered when it delivers current (_secondary cell_).

A battery usually consists of two or more cells.

two types:
1. dry - the material is a paste
2. wet - the material is a liquid

### Primary Cell
- supplies current
- commonly dry (ex. ammonium chloride (chemical paste) in a zinc container (used as a negative electrode) and carbon as a positive electrode)
- the zinc is eaten away by the chemical paste as the cell supplies current
- once all the zinc is eaten away, the cell is "dead" and must be discarded

### Secondary Cell
- commonly wet (ex. lead peroxide as the positive electrode and lead as the negative electrode, the electrolyte is )
## Turbine
- weighs around 40-50 lbs
- provides mechanical energy in order to rotate a magnet in the generator

## Generator
- spins at 3600 rpm to generate electricity at 60 Hz
- operates faster or slower depending on load (__load__ -> demand)

### 3-phase generator
- the main type of generator at HECO
- generates electricity at 3 different phases (20$\degree$ out of phase)

## Transformer
changes voltage and current between a primary and secondary circuit
- used to transmit high voltage and low current (secondary side) and generate low voltage and high current (primary side)
- current lowers as voltage rises as per conservation of energy.
$$
P = VI
$$
- high voltages are used to deliver electricity over farther distances

## Switches and Circuit Breakers

__switch__ - a manually controlled device that opens and closes a circuit. does not carry any load.
__circuit breaker__ - an automatically or manually controlled device that 

### Air Circuit Breakers (ACB)
- used in low voltage circuits (230 or 480 V) or medium voltage circuits (2400 or 4160 V)

### Oil Circuit Breakers (OCB)
- used in high voltage circuits (12 KV to 230 KV)

### Gas Circuit Breakers (GCB)
- used in very high voltage circuits (500 KV)
- gas used is a compound of sulfur and fluorine known as sulfur hexafluorine ($SF_6$)
