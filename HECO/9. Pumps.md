---

__Pumps__ add energy to a liquid to raise its pressure.

Types:
-	Positive displacement
-	Jet pumps
-	Centrifugul

## Positive Displacement Pumps
A positive displacement pump moves or displacement a constant positive volume of liquid

Two types:
-	Rotary (circular motion; gears)
-	Reciprocating (back and forth motion; piston)

### Rotary type
-	Internal gear pumps
-	External gear pumps
-	Rotary lobe pumps
-	Sliding vane pumps

The flow of rotary type pumps are steady unlike reciprocating types.

### Reciprocating type

Most effecient for relatively small flow rates and high pressure.
