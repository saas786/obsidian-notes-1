# 9. Pumps
---

__Pumps__ add energy to a liquid to raise its pressure. Converts mechanical energy to kinetic energy.

Types:
-	Positive displacement
-	Jet pumps
-	Centrifugul

## Positive Displacement Pumps
A positive displacement pump moves or displacement a constant positive volume of liquid

Two types:
-	Rotary (circular motion; gears)
-	Reciprocating (back and forth motion; piston)

### Rotary type
-	Internal gear pumps
-	External gear pumps
-	Rotary lobe pumps
-	Sliding vane pumps

The flow of rotary type pumps are steady unlike reciprocating types.

### Reciprocating type

Most effecient for relatively small flow rates and high pressure.
Classified by number of pistons

## Centrifugul
Most popular type of pump due to:
-	simple -- less moving parts compared to positive displacement
-	compact
-	low cost

Centrifugal pumps operate under a variety of conditions
Force moves rotating body away from center of rotation
Amount of force:
-	weight of body (weight of liquid)
-	distance from center of rotation (shaft diameter)
-	speed of rotation

__priming__ -- filling the pump with fluid prior to operating
__cavitation__ -- damage to the impeller due to steam bubbles collapsing within the pump

Centrifugal pumps operate satisfactorily, they must be filled with water prior to starting (priming) and must remain full during operation. They can operate even under positive pressure.

As fluid leaves the pump, it slows down due to the increasing size of the area. When the fluid slows down, it picks up pressure.

Essential Parts:
-	impeller -- rotating member with vanes
-	volute casing

Components:
-	condensate pump vent
-	foot valve
-	BFP recirculation

Classes:
1.	volute type
2.	diffuser type

### Radial flow vs. Axial flow
__radial flow__ -- flow along the rotation of the impeller
__axial flow__ -- flow parallel to the axis of rotation
__mixed flow__ -- a combination of radial and axial flow

The impeller is driven by an electric motor, steam turbine, or internal combustion engine.

### Shaft Sealing
Minimizes leaking of water out the pump or air into the pump. Pumps may allow a certain amount of leaking to extend the lifetime of the shaft sleeves.

#### Stuffing Box
- packing rings
- shaft
- shaft sleeve
- adjusting nut
- pump case
- follower or gland

#### Shaft Sleeves
-	hardened steel (withstands friction/wear)
-	covers area of shaft

#### Pump Bearings
-	sleeve bearings
	-	==always oil lubricated==
-	ball and roller bearings
	-	==oil or grease lubricated==
	
Oil level can be observed using sight glasses. There are acceptable and unacceptable levels of oil.

### Hydraulic balance
#### Pressure Increases
-	inlet to discharge
-	unbalanced hydraulic forces on shaft
	-	produces thrust
-	ways to compensate for thrust:
	-	thrust bearing
	-	half of impellers faced in reversed direction
	-	==balancing disk or drum==
		-	most common
		-	discharge end of pump
		-	one side discharge pressure
		-	one side suction pressure

### Pump Operation

![[Pasted image 20211117134720.png]]

__pump curve__ -- a graph showing the relationship between the capacity or flow of the pump to the pressure or head it produces.

Operating the pump at a constant speed determines the curve. Pumps using electric motors operate at essentially constant speed.

To change the flow of the pump the pressure can be changed (usually by adjusting a valve in the discharge piping) which will cause the pump's operating point to move along the curve to a different point. The speed of the pump can be changed which moves the curve.

- Check valves in discharge piping (prevents reverse flow through pump)

#### Centrifugal Pumps
If the flow of the pump is reduced below its definite minimum flow, it will cause the water within to heat up and eventually turn to steam (__pump flash__).
If the pump flashes, it becomes vapor-bound and ceases to operate. It can also overheat which will cause rubbing or seizing

#### Condensate pumps
-	pump suction under vacuum
-	air vented when filling

-	water supply to elevated pumps
	-	foot valve
		-	check valve
		-	flow up, not down
		
## Affinity Laws
Used in hydraulics to express the mathematical relationship between the several variables (such as _head_, _volumetric flow rate_, speed, and power) involved in pump and fan performance, and are also used to compare different pumps or fans with each other. They apply to all types of centrifugal and axial flow pumps and fans, and to hydraulic turbines

1. Flow is proportional to shaft speed:
$$
CFM_{2} = CFM_{1} (\frac{RPM_{2}}{RPM_{1}})
$$
2. TDH or Head is proportional to the square of shaft speed:
$$
TDH_{2} = TDH_{1} (\frac{RPM_{2}}{RPM_{1}})^2
$$
3. BHP or Power is proportional to the cube of shaft speed:
$$
BHP_{2} = BHP_{1} (\frac{RPM_{2}}{RPM_{1}})^3
$$
