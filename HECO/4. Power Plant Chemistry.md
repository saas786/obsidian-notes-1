__Physical Properties__ -> can be described without reference to any other substance, examples:
- color
- material
- appaerance

__Chemical Properties__ -> described with reference to other substances

ex. Coke + Mentos -> physical reaction
ex. Water + Dry Ice -> physical reaction
ex. Baking Soda + Vinegar -> chemical reaction

Categories of matter:
1. Elements
2. Mixtures
3. Compounds

__corrosion__ -> damage due to a chemical reaction
__erosion__ -> damage due to the flow of a substance ^eb9c95

## Ions
__anions__ -> negatively charged ion
__cations__ -> positively charged ion

## Chemistry of $H_2O$
Water ($H_2O$) is a compound of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom
Salt ($NaCl$) dissolves in water -> solution

### Acid or Alkali
More positive (ex. hydrogen ($H+$) compounds) -> acidic solution
More negative (ex. hydroxide ($OH^-$) compounds) than negative -> alkaline (basic) solution
Balance of positive and negative -> neutral solution

Measured using the pH scale
pH of 0 -> strong acid (ex. hydrochloric acid)
pH of 7 -> neutral (ex. water)
pH of 14 -> strong base (ex. bleach)

pH 0 - 6 -> acidic
pH 8 - 14 -> alkaline

## Conductivity
#conductivity
units: $\frac{1}{\Omega \text{cm}}$ mhos per centimeter (mhos = 1/ohms)
measure of electrical resistance of a material

## Solubility
#solubility
units: ppm (parts per million)
measure of how much of a material or substance will dissolve in liquid
saturation -> solution that cannot dissolve any more material
- solubility increases with temperature
- relative to if molecules in the substance are polar (ionic) or non-polar
- solubility of gas affected with pressure
- larger molecules are less soluble

## Precipitation
#precipitation
when a chemical is added to a solution, causing a reaction that forms a new compound that is not soluable, this new solid material is called a __precipitate__.

## Five (5) Water Systems
__carry-over__ -> the condition when water droplets are carried along with the steam leaving the boiler drum
__scale__ -> a coating resulting from a high concentration of dissolved calcium and magnesium ^5bf170
- can be minimized through _distillation_ or _demineralization_.

### 1. Make-up Water
increases conductivity and minimizes scaling
- Chemical treatment to:
	- remove impurities
	- maintain heat transfer surfaces
- Demineralizer (reduces scaling) to:
	- removes minerals from the water
	- uses ion exchange method to take out impurities and solids
- Electrodialysis Reversal Process (EDR)
	- electrochemical + membrane cell technologies
	
### 2. Condensate & Feedwater
controls corrosion due to dissolved oxygen gas and low pH
- Treat to Control
	- reduce corrosion from dissolved oxygen gas
		- De-aerator	
		- Hydrazine chemical
	- lower pH
		- corrosion lowest in 10-12 pH range
		- ammonia
	- Dissolved solids
		- conductivity
		
### 3. Boiler Water
- Control dissolved material
	- minimize scale
	- minimize [[4. Power Plant Chemistry#^eb9c95|corrosion]]
	- minimize [[4. Power Plant Chemistry#^5bf170|carry-over]]
	- minimize silica (reduces heat exchange in the water)

### 4. Closed Cooling Water
controls corrosion
- Treated Cooling Water
	
### 5. Circulating Water
controls algae and slime
- Circulating Water
	- Chlorine -> control algae and slime
