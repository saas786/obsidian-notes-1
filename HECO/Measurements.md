## Measured Variables
All variables measured typically in a power plant.

### Pressure
Units: PSI (pounds per square inch)

The force that is being exerted on an area.
Areas of high pressure will want to move to areas of lower pressure.

### Temperature

### Flow

### Level

### Conductivity

### Oxygen

### $H^{+}$ Concentration

### Position

### $N_{2}H_{4}$ Concentration

### $PO_{4}$ Concentration

### Combustibles

### Hydrogen

### Smoke Density

### Speed
Units: RPM (revolutions per minute)

## Other Variables

### Viscosity
Units: SSU (Saybolt Universeal Second Units)

Measures viscosity of a liquid. The higher the SSU, the less thick it is.
Usually used to measure viscosity of fuel oil. This is done by testing a sample of the oil in a lab, which the results are then matched to a certain SSU using a SSU table.
