# Introduction to the Steam Power Plant

Boiling point $\rightarrow 212\degree F$ at normal ATM, sea level

Raise pressure -> lower boiling point

Why steam:
- source of heat and pressure
- convenient & economical (water is everywhere)
- easy to make
- easy to control
- versatile

Dry (saturated) or superheated steam:
- produced when water is boiled at a high enough temperature
- colorless vapor
- turns white (wet steam) a short distance from the source

Wet steam:
- produced when dry steam cools down
- white in color
- less heat per pound than dry steam

Boiling water with minerals produces "scaling" (looks white):
- can mitigate by (1) distilling or (2) dimineralizing the water

[[Teapot Theory]]

Waiau:
- 2 combustion turbines

Measuring pressure -> Steam Tables
- Can find pressure from volume of water/steam, H, U

Plant cycles: chemical energy -> thermal energy -> mechanical energy

```nomnoml
[chemical energy] burn fuel to produce steam -> [thermal energy]
[thermal energy] steam powering turbine-> [mechanical energy]
[mechanical energy] turbine powering generator -> [electricity]
```


Extracting steam from turbine:
- sends preheated steam back into the boiler but takes it away from the turbine to power the generator
- if preheated steam is sent into the boiler, not as much fuel will be needed to produce more steam

- pumping condensated water is better than extracting wet steam

## Condensate and Feedwater
Condensate
- Steam enters condenser
- passes through a series a tubes with cooler water passing through it
- condensate is sent to condensate pump

Heat Exchanger
- Tank containing many pipes with material "to be heated" (usually water or oil)
- Takes heated steam (from turbine) in order to heat the pipes and material

## Simple Plant Circle

1. water, fuel, air sent into boiler
2. boiler converts water into steam
3. steam powers turbine
4. turbine is connected to a generator
5. generator generates electricity

## Simplified Plant Circle

1. steam from turbine is sent into a condenser
2. condensed water is sent back into the boiler

## Combustion Turbine Generator
- Burns fuel to power a turbine which powers a generator

## Combined Cycle
- Uses a combustion turbine generator to heat water in a steam plant, as well as generate electricity

## Heat Rate
$$
\text{Heat Rate} = \frac{\text{Fuel Energy Consumed}}{\text{Electrical Energy Produced}}
$$
- lower -> more efficient


Btu: British Thermal Units
KWH: Kilowatt-Hour,

### For Steam Plants
Ideal: 3412 Btu/KWH -> 100% efficiency
In Practice: 1000 Btu/KWH -> ~30% efficiency

50% energy lost to the cooling water, 20% lost up the stack and 30% converted to electricity

### For Combustion Turbines
50% energy lost to the cooling water, 15% lost up the stack and 35% converted to electricity
