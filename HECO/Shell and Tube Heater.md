__Shell and tube heat exchangers__ consist of a shell, or casing, with a bundle of tubes inside.
__shell side__ -- the area inside the casing but outside the tubes
__tube side__ -- the area inside the tubes

Some shell-and-tube heat exchangers can be single pass or 2-pass, representing how many times the material in the tube side passes through the heat exchanger. 

In a 2-pass heat exhanger, the tubes form a u-turn. This means the tube inlet/outlet will be on the same side.
