# 19. Circulating Water

Functions:
-	provides cooling water to the main condenser
-	can also be used as auxiliary cooling water for other systems in the plant

Components:
-	bar screens
-	traveling screens
-	chlorinating equipment
-	circulating water pumps
-	condensors
-	auxiliary cooling water systems

## Bar Screens
Function:
-	prevents large floating debris from passing through into the circulating water inlet

Waiau -> course mesh used as bar screen
Kahe -> literal metal bars used as bar screen

## Traveling Screens
Function:
-	provides further cleaning of the circulating water by trapping debris that can plug the condenser

Screen Mesh:
-	approximately 5/8"

## Screen Wash
Function:
-	washes debris off of the traveling screens

Debris are washed off the screens periodically by rotating them past fixed water sprays. The debris is collected into basins and dumped.

The screen wash cycle can be started manually or automatically. Automatic operation is controlled by a screen differential level device.

Alarms:
-	Screens high differential

## Circulating Water Pump (CWP)
Function:
-	takes suction from circulating water after traveling screens

---
-	vertical pump
-	high volume
-	low pressure (1-2 psig)
-	rated at 23,650 gallons per minute (GMP)

## Condenser
[[18. Condensate & Feedwater#Condenser]]


## Chlorine Dioxide
Function:
-	added to the circulating water to prevent algae groth
