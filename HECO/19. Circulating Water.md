# 19. Circulating Water

Functions:
-	provides cooling water to the main condenser
-	can also be used as auxiliary cooling water for other systems in the plant

Components:
-	bar screens
-	traveling screens
-	chlorinating equipment
-	circulating water pumps
-	condensors
-	auxiliary cooling water systems

## Bar Screens
Function:
-	prevents large floating debris from passing through into the circulating water inlet

Waiau -> course mesh used as bar screen
Kahe -> literal metal bars used as bar screen

## Traveling Screens
Function:
-	provides further cleaning of the circulating water by trapping debris that can plug the condenser

Screen Mesh:
-	approximately 5/8"

## Screen Wash
Function:
-	washes debris off of the traveling screens

Debris are washed off the screens periodically by rotating them past fixed water sprays. The debris is collected into basins and dumped.

The screen wash cycle can be started manually or automatically. Automatic operation is controlled by a screen differential level device.

Alarms:
-	Screens high differential

## Circulating Water Pump (CWP)
Function:
-	takes suction from circulating water after traveling screens

---
-	vertical pump
-	high volume
-	low pressure (1-2 psig)
-	rated at 23,650 gallons per minute (GMP)

## Condenser
[[18. Condensate & Feedwater#Condenser]]

The circulating water flows through the condenser on the tube side.

In case of a tube leak:
-	a barrel of sawdust is provided
-	by dumping the sawdust into the circulating water inlet, the leak is hopefully plugged by the pieces of wood or slows it down

## Lube Water Pumps
Function:
-	provides lubrication to the spinning rotors in the circulating water pumps
-	takes suction from the stilling basin

## Screen Wash Pumps
Function:
-	provides water under pressure to clean the traveling screens
-	takes suction from circulating water after the traveling screens

## Service Water Pumps
Function:
-	provides auxiliary cooling water to various plant equipment, such as hydrogen coolers and lube oil coolers
-	takes suction from a supply of circulating water located downstream from the traveling screen
-	the water is chemically treated to reduce corrosion and contamination

Prior to the use of service water pumps, circulating water was used as auxiliary cooling water which caused excessive corrosion and contamination.

## Chillers
Function:
-	heat exchangers used to cool auxiliary cooling water

## Chlorine Dioxide
Function:
-	added to the circulating water to prevent algae groth

Chlorine Dioxide Skid:
-	collection of containers of hydrochloric acid, sodium chlorite, and sodium hypochlorite
-	mixed to produce chlorine dioxide

These chemicals are injected as a gas inside the condenser and combines with the circulating water.
