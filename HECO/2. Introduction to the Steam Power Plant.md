Boiling point $\rightarrow 212\degree F$ at normal ATM, sea level

Raise pressure -> lower boiling point

## Why steam?
- source of heat and pressure
- convenient & economical (water is everywhere)
- easy to make
- easy to control
- versatile

## Types of steam
- Superheated steam:
    - contains the most energy
	- produced when water is boiled at a high enough temperature
	- colorless vapor
- Dry steam / Saturated steam:
	- initially colorless vapor
	- turns white (wet steam) a short distance from the source
- Wet steam / Flash steam:
	- produced when dry steam cools down
	- white in color
	- less heat per pound than dry steam

Boiling water with minerals produces "scaling" (looks white):
- can minimize by (1) distilling or (2) dimineralizing the water


[[Teapot Theory]]

Waiau:
- 2 combustion turbines

Measuring pressure -> Steam Tables
- Can find pressure from volume of water/steam, H ([[Enthalpy]]), U

Plant cycles: chemical energy (fuel) -> thermal energy (heat) -> mechanical energy (spinning turbines) -> electrical energy

```nomnoml
[chemical energy] burn fuel to produce steam -> [thermal energy]
[thermal energy] steam powering turbine-> [mechanical energy]
[mechanical energy] turbine powering generator -> [electricity]
```

__economizer__ - preheats the boiler feedwater by using heat in the flue gasses leaving the boiler; lowers heat-rate

Extracting steam from turbine:
- sends preheated steam back into the boiler but takes it away from the turbine to power the generator
- if preheated steam is sent into the boiler, not as much fuel will be needed to produce more steam

- pumping condensated water is better than extracting wet steam

## Simple Plant Cycle Components

### Steam Generator / Boiler
__combustion__ - the process of burning fuel (chemical energy -> thermal energy)
__feedwater__ - the water supplied to the boiler
- converts chemical energy into thermal energy
- burns fuel (supplied with the proper amount of air) in order to heat feedwater
- converts water into high pressure steam

### Steam Turbine
- converts thermal energy into mechanical energy
- takes high pressure steam supplied by the boiler
- the energy stored in the steam (due to its high temperature and pressure) is given to the turbines when the steam expands, causing the shaft of the turbine to rotate

### Electric Generator
- converts mechnical energy into electrical energy
- the generator shaft is rotated along with the turbine shaft
- rotation of the generator shaft generates electricity

## Simplified Plant Cycle Components

### Condenser
[[Condensate & Feedwater]]
__steam cycle__ -> when steam turns back into water
- converts the steam from the turbine back into water (condensate)
- provides an area of low pressure due to the reduction in volume from steam to water
- used to re-use the steam as feedwater
- condensate is stored in the hotwell

### Hotwell
- stores condensate produced by the condensor
- provides a supply of water for the feedwater pump to pull from

### Feedwater Pump
- pumps water from the hotwell to the boiler

(in the simplified plant cycle, there is no condensate pump and thus the feedwater pump is the condensate pump)

## Actual Plant Cycle Components

### Condensate Pump
- pumps water from the hotwell through the air ejectors, gland steam condensor, and three (3) feedwater heaters to the feedwater pump

### Feedwa


## Heat Exchanger
- Tank containing many pipes with material "to be heated" (usually water or oil)
- Takes heated steam (from turbine) in order to heat the pipes and material

## Combustion Turbine Generator
- Burns fuel to power a turbine which powers a generator

## Plant Cycles

### Simple Plant Circle

1. water, fuel, air sent into boiler
2. boiler converts water into steam
3. steam powers turbine
4. turbine is connected to a generator
5. generator generates electricity

### Simplified Plant Circle

1. steam from turbine is sent into a condenser
2. condensed water is sent back into the boiler

### Combined Cycle
- Uses a combustion turbine generator to heat water in a steam plant, as well as generate electricity

## Heat Rate
$$
\text{Heat Rate} = \frac{\text{Fuel Energy Consumed}}{\text{Electrical Energy Produced}}
$$
- lower -> more efficient


Btu: British Thermal Units - measures how much thermal energy is stored in a unit of fuel
KWH: Kilowatt-Hour,

### For Steam Plants
Ideal: 3412 Btu/KWH -> 100% efficiency
In Practice: 1000 Btu/KWH -> ~30% efficiency

50% energy lost to the cooling water, 20% lost up the stack and 30% converted to electricity

### For Combustion Turbines
50% energy lost to the cooling water, 15% lost up the stack and 35% converted to electricity
