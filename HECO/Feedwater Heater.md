## Feedwater Heaters (FWHs)
Uses extraction steam from the turbine to pre-heat the water entering the boiler.

Types of FWHs:
1.	Open (or contact) feedwater heaters
	-	steam and feedwater mix in the same space
2.	Closed feedwater heaters
	-	no mixing occurs
	
The effectiveness of either type depends on the net loss to the cycle resulting from transferring heat from the steam to the feedwater. ([[Terminal Temperature Difference|TTD]])

## Open (Contact) FWHs
In this FWH, extraction steam and feedwater are discharged at saturation conditions.
At saturation, water cannot hold gases in solution. ==This effectively deaerates the feedwater==.

TTD is 0 but each contact heater must be followed by a pump.

## Closed FWHs
This FWH is a [[Shell and Tube Heater]] where feedwater enters the tube side through the feedwater inlet and the inlet water box and flows to through the tubes to the outlet water box. Extraction steam, taken from the turbine, enters the extraction steam inlet to the shell side and is used to heat the feedwater.

__# passes__ -- number of times the water goes the length of the heater

==Features==:
-	U-tubes
-	Drain outlet
-	Water box

### High Pressure Feedwater Heater

-> Steam Inlet
-> Feedwater Inlet

Condensate Outlet ->

This FWH takes extraction steam from the HP section of the turbine, meaning steam will enter it at a superheated temperature.
Some heaters may contain a de-superheating section (occurs before the condenser section) where the steam is cooled to a saturation temperature.
