# Checks
- look, hear, touch
 
local alarm -> next to the equipment
checking oil flows -> through a window or measured through a gauge

## Valves
always check position by attempting to close the valve first

## Lube Oil

-	Usually should be half full
-	Some equipment (ex. [[12. Boilers and Accessories#Forced Draft Fans|Forced Draft Fans]]) have more than one sight glass. All of them should be checked

## Lube Oil System
-	Ensure there is flow through the sight glass

## Pumps
-	Check oil levels
-	Feel for normal vibrations if running
-	Look for any leaks
