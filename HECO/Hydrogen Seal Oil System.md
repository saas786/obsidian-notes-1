Functions:
-	prevent hydrogen from escaping
-	lubricate seal rings
-	minimize air, moisture, oil, and other contaminants that get in the generator so the hydrogen purity can be maintained

## Components
-	Vacuum Tank
	-	removes gases & water vapor entrained in oil
	-	provides oil storage
-	Vacuum Pump
	-	maintain vacuum in the vacuum tank to facilitate removal of any entrained air, gas, and moisture
-	Separator Tank
	-	condenses exhausts from the vacuum pump and vents the gases to atmosphere
	-	collects water - water settles to the bottom and must be drained
	-	tracks volume of water drained to use as a problem indicator
-	Drain Regulator
	-	regulates oil coming from the hydrogen side drain of the defoaming tank
		-	want to maintain oil level about center of tank
	-	provides oil seal barrier between hydrogen and air side drains
-	Cuno Filter
	-	filters high pressure oil going to the turbine oil system
-	AC Pump
	-	normal seal oil supply
	-	regulated to 12psi greater than gas pressure at the seals
-	Seal Oil Cooler
-	Defoaming Tank
	-	assists in removing any entrained hydrogen in the oil
	-	foam layer floats on oil, keeps foam in defoaming tank allowing foam time to break down
	-	level in tank is maintained by the overflow connections
-	DC Pump (Emergency)
	-	does not maintain purity of hydrogen as well as AC pump
	-	last supply of seal oil designed to maintain hydrogen in the generator during a loss of all AC power
	-	maintains a seal oil pressure at 12psi greater than gas pressure
-	Seal Oil Pressure Regulators
	-	balanced disc valves
	-	main regulator maintains seal oil at 12psi above generator gas pressure
	-	backup regulator maintains seal oil at 8psi above generator gas pressure
	-	spring bias is used to set the pressure control point
-	Generator Loop Seal
	-	prevents a release of hydrogen from the generator to the lube oil reservoir in the event of a seal failure, or when the vacuum tank is not in service
-	Seal Oil Return Tank
-	Back Up Regulator
-	ACW Line to Seal Oil Cooler
-	Vacuum Pump

Backup Mode:
-	Seal oil pressure at seal drops to 8 psi greater than generator gas pressure
	-	Backup regulator opens to maintain 8psi over gas
	-	Backup supply from turbine lube oil system
-	Hydrogen purity degrades
	-	Vacuum tank bypassed
	-	contaminants present in seal oil
	-	additional hydrogen needed daily to maintain purity

Emergency Mode:
-	If seal oil pressure drops to 5psi greater than generator gas pressure
	-	DC seal oil pump starts
	-	Main regulator maintains 12psi over gas pressure
	-	Short term - no other backup if DC trips or fails

When must system be in operation:
-	prior to placing the turbine on turning gear
-	prior to any gases being admitted into the generator enclosure

Alarms:
-	defoaming tank high level alarm
-	drain regulator H2 side low level alarm
-	seal oil low pressure alarm - 5 psid
-	emergency seal oil pump starts with seal oil pressure drops to 5psi over gas pressure
-	seal oil pump off - when seal oil pump discharge drops to 5psig
