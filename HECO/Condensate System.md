Purposes:
-	Provides condensate to the Boiler Feed Pump (BFP)
	-	at increased pressure; sufficient net positive suction head
-	Improve unit effeciency
	-	use low pressure feedwater heaters to increase temperature
-	Provide cooling water
	-	to use in the gland steam condenser and air ejector condensor
-	Provide make-up water to various systems
-	Control hotwell level 
	
As condensate passes through the condensor & feedwater system, its temperature and pressure gradually increase.

Major Components:
- main condensor
- hotwell
- condensate pumps
- gland steam condensers
- air ejector condensors
- de-aerator
- hot surge tank
- boiler feed pumps
	- increase the pressure of feedwater until it can pass through the high pressure feedwater heaters
	- variable speed and used for flow control
- high-pressure heater
- feedwater regulating valve

### Alarms & Switches
-	Hotwell level high and low
-	Hotwell and condensate pump
	-	high conductivity
-	Condensate pH high and low level alarms
-	Condensate header & pump discharge low pressure
	-	APS
