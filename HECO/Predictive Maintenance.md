# Predictive Maintenance (PdM)
Speaker: John Itai, Sr. Supervisor Reliability & Performance Engineering

## What is Predictive Maintenance?
A **process** which requires **technologies** and **people skills** as well as combining and using all available diagnostic and performance data, mainteneance histories, operator logs, failure modes, and design data to make **timely decisions** about maintenance requirements of critical equipment.

## Why PdM?
PdM detects problems in equipment early, hopefully allowing them to be fixed before the equipment eventually fails.
-	also minimizes the cost of repair (earlier = cheaper)

-	Gain control of our maintenance work
	-	can plan and schedule the work
	-	do the correct maintenance at the right time in a cost effective manner
-	improve unit and equipment reliability
-	improve unit heat rate
-	reduce maintenance costs
-	improve safety
