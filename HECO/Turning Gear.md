When the turbine is on **turning gear**, the rotor turns at a constant speed using a motor and gear arrangement. This is used during turbine shutdown to prevent sagging in the rotor.

The turning gear motor can be located externally on the end of the turbine. In case the motor breaks, it can be manually operated by turning a knob connected to the gear with a wrench.
