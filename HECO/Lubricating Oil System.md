# Lubricating Oil System
Section 22
Speaker: Laurie



Desired Properties:
-	Low viscosity
-	High demulsibility
-	High durability

Causes of Oil Deterioration
-	Changes within itself -	composition breakdown (e.g. temperature transients, age)
-	Outside contamination
	-	water (e.g. turbine shaft steam & water seals, oil cooler leaks, airborne moisture in piping & reservoir)
	-	air ($\text{O}_2$ in air causes oxidation, creates sludge)
	
## Pall Purifier
Removes moisture and dissolved gas/water in oil using a process called **vacuum dehydration**.
-	Removes 100% of free water and entrained air
-	Removes up to 80% of dissolved gas/water

Gases:
-	expand in size
-	decrease in relative humidity

Oils:
-	release moisture to air via mass transfer
-	dissolved air in oil released

Components:
-	heater
-	vacuum tower
	-	vacuum pump & motor
-	outlet filter

true

>5. High performance in oil is attained by adding various chemicals or additives. True \ False



>6. When lube oil is subjected to pressure, it increases its viscosity. True \ False

>7. The clean oil tank holds clean oil and the used oil tank holds used oil that has been centrifuged and filtered. True \ False

>8. What is a Bowser?

>9. Name the compartments in a Bowser and list the function of each.

>10. When the oil level in the filtering system rises above the normal operating level, it indicates that the screened trays should be removed and cleaned. True \ False

>11. Why is it important that the vapor extractor be in service whenever there is hydrogen in the generator?

>12. What is the purpose of the bearing oil coolers? 

>13. Why is it important that a bearing oil cooler be checked for oil flow before transferring coolers?
