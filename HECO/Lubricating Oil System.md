# Lubricating Oil System
Section 22
Speaker: Laurie

Function:
-	Provides continuous flow of lubricating oil to major equipment
	-	Turbine
	-	Larger pumps (ex. BFP)
-	At correct temperature
	-	Temperature affects properties
	-	Oil removes heat from bearings
-	Lube oil -> high quality refined petrolum

Goals:
-	Maintain Lubricating Oil Cleanliness
	-	Remove and Keep Out water/moisture, air particulates, dust, and dirt
-	Proper Handling of Lubricating Oils
	-	Wear PPE (gloves, glasses or face shield)
	-	Clean up spills immediately
	-	Inform SS of spills
	-	Properly dispose of oil, oil soaked materials

Desired Properties:
-	Low viscosity
	-	viscosity - measurement to describe oil's relative resistance to flow
		-	changes with temperature
-	High demulsibility
	-	demulsibility - ability to readily separate from water
-	High durability
	-	durability - characteristics of chemical stability; how resistant it is to air, water, particulates, or other impurities
-	Temperature -> 110 F (both Lube Oil and Seal Oil)

Causes of Oil Deterioration
-	Changes within itself -	composition breakdown (e.g. temperature transients, age)
-	Outside contamination
	-	water (e.g. turbine shaft steam & water seals, oil cooler leaks, airborne moisture in piping & reservoir)
	-	air ($\text{O}_2$ in air causes oxidation, creates sludge)
	
## Turbine Lube Oil Reservoir
Function:
-	Supply Tank
-	Return Tank
-	Storage Tank
-	Settling Tank to drop out sediment

## Lube Oil Pumps
-	AC Auxiliary Lube Oil Pump
	-	used during unit start-ups and shutdowns
	-	used as an emergency back-up to the main bearing 
-	[[Turning Gear]] Lube Oil Pump
	-	services turbine bearing when turbine is on turning gear (shutting down)
-	DC Lube Oil Pump
	-	used for emergencies when no AC power is available
	-	used as a backup for the turning gear LO pump

## Lube Oil Coolers
A heat exchanger that cools the oil (using ACW) before returning the oil to the turbine bearings.

## Lube Oil Vapor Extractor
Removes air and oil vapors that accumulate inside the reservoir between the oil level and the top of the reservoir

### Checks
-	Monitor vacuum
-	If hydrogen is inside the generator make sure the vapor extractor is in service

## Bowser
An oil conditioner that filters out debris and moisture in the oil.
Oil is supplied from the LO reservoir.
Oil that goes through the Bowser can be pumped back to the reservoir for reuse.

Components:
-	precipitation or settling compartment
	-	removes moisture entrained in lube oil
-	filter bag compartment
	-	removes large foreign particulates
	-	operator replaces filter bags
-	cartridge filter compartment (polisher)
	-	removes smaller particulates
	-	operator replaces filters
	
## BFP Lube Oil Reservoir
Can be serviced from the LO tanks or drained back to the tanks.

## DeLaval Lube Oil Purifier
Removes entrained water in oil.
-	routine centrifuging of oil
-	removes moisture and debris from the lube oil
-	normally in service to the used lube oil tank
-	prime before using

## Pall Lube Oil Purifier
Removes moisture and dissolved gas/emulsified water in oil using a process called **vacuum dehydration**.
-	Removes 100% of free water and entrained air
-	Removes up to 80% of dissolved gas/water

Gases:
-	expand in size
-	decrease in relative humidity

Oils:
-	release moisture to air via mass transfer
-	dissolved air in oil released

Components:
-	heater
-	vacuum tower
	-	vacuum pump & motor
-	outlet filter

### PALL Alarms
-	High Tower Alarm
	-	sometimes caused by high rate of low viscosity oil flowing into PALL when Lexair valve opens
	-	check rise and fall times of floats
-	Low Tower Alarm
	-	trigger when HVP can't being enough fluid to tower
	-	check tower vacuum
	-	check inlet vacuum gauge
	-	check oil temperature & viscosity
	-	check inlet strainer
	
## Turbine Lube Oil Subsystems
-	Lubricating Oil - keeps turbine bearings cool
-	High Pressure Oil - to main and auxiliary governors, supplies high pressure oil to allow the turbine to be latched
-	Governer Control Oil - position the turbine valves (governer valves, RH stop, intercept valves)
-	Gonverner Seal Oil Back Up - provide high pressure oil to seal oil back up regulator
-	Auto Stop Oil - provides for turbine trip devices (trip block) to be reset (latch turbine)

### Turbine Lube Oil Alarms
-	Reservoir high or low level
-	AC Aux LO Pump running
-	Turning Gear LO Pump running
-	DC LO Pump Running
-	Bearing Oil Pressure Low
-	Lube Oil Temperature from Cooler High
