## Pipes

### Fluid Flow
- liquids
- continuity equation

#### Continuity Equation
![[Pasted image 20211112081358.png]]

$$
Q = AV
$$
Q: flow rate
A: area (size of pipe)
V: velocity

![[HECO/_attachments/6. Valves and Piping Systems_2021-11-12 08.14.18.excalidraw.md]]
$$
Q_{1} = Q_{2}
$$
$$ \begin{equation}
A_{1}V_{1}=A_{2}V_{2}
\end{equation} $$
- $A_2$ increases, so $V_2$ decreases
- $A_3$ decreases, so $V_3$ increases

#### General Energy Equation
$$
PE + KE + FE
$$
P: potential energy
K: kinetic energy (proportional to $V^{2}$)
F: flow energy (proportional to pressure $\rho$)

$$
PE_{1}+KE_{1}+FE_{1}=PE_{2}+KE_{2}+FE_{2}
$$
- if one parameter changes, so does another parameter in order to satisfy conservation of energy

$$
V_{1}^{2}+P_{1} = V_{2}^{2}+P_{2}
$$

## Pipe Material
- most common:
	- alloy steel
	- carbon steel
- stainless steel
- copper (common in households for drinking/potable water, used in low pressure, does not corrode the water)
- brass 
- plastic (e.g ABS, PVC, CPVC, polyethylene) (common in house plumbing, low pressure)

## Pipe Markings
ASTM: american society ??
NPS 4": nominal pipe size (4 inches)
SCH-10S: schedule number (higher number -> higher rating -> can handle more pressure)
- S represents material (stainless steel)

### Pipe Chart
- can determine outside diameter, wall thickness, inside diameter, etc. from the schedule number

## Connections
- threaded / screw connections
	- most common in water service
	- smaller diameter
	- low to moderate pressures
- welded
	- higher pressures
	- larger diameter pipes

tack weld: used to hold pipe in place to be welded

## Expansion Joint
![[Pasted image 20211112084054.png]]

used to allow for changes in piping caused by varied temperatures and pressures across the system

## Expansion Loops
![[Pasted image 20211112084344.png]]

- sturdy, welded pipes
- used to allow for pipes to expand and contract with changes in pressure
- can be upright or laid down

## Piping Supports
- hanging pipe supports
	- pipes supported by rollers to allow sliding back and forward
- spring pipe supports
	- pipes supported by springs to allow vibrations
	
### Rigid support
- shoe
- saddle
- base adjustable support
- dummy support
- trunnion

### Flexible support
- various hanging supports

## Valves
- used to control flow or prevent flow reversal
- either on or off

types:
- gate
	- used on or off
	- corrosion can damage it if partially open
- globe
	- less damage to the valve seat / valve plug
	- closing it too far can damage the valve and valve seat
- plug or cock
	- turns 90$\degree$ to completely close
- ball valve
	- used on or off
	- valve seat may be damaged when used partially open
- butterfly
	- can use for throttling (in low pressure)
- check
	- prevents reverse flow using a flap inside the valve
	- flow direction marked on outside of valve
	
- steam trap
	- operates by difference in temperature
	- closes when hot steam is detected in pipe
	- used to collect condensate
	
### Valve Operation
proper use
-	appropriate service
-	closed correctly

leaks
-	symptom of a problem
-	troubleshoot - scale or buildup, debris
	-	open and close the valve in order to break away scale
-	correct the problem
	-	submit a "notification" that describes the problem and depending on problem a work order may be issued to fix it

positive shutoff required
-	2 valves in series
-	first valve is a positive shutoff valve
-	second valve is a "sacrificial" valve to replace while first valve is closed

large gate valves
-	valve may be difficult to open due to high difference in pressure
-	equalizing lines
	-	second valve that bypasses main valve in order to equalize pressure on both sides
	
## Water Hammer
occurs when stopping the flow of water
waves may form in pipes due to air pockets that contains energy
-	can be heard
-	can cause damage due to waves reflecting across pipe system as it dissipates

causes:
-	hydraulic shock (valve closed too abruptly)
	-	check valves may also cause hydraulic shock
	-	avoided by slowly closing valves
		- silent check valves
-	thermal shock (steam leaks into condensate forming air pockets)
	-	can also be caused by a malfunctioning steam trap
	-	can also be caused in heat exchangers due to it not being completely filled
	-	avoided by adding a fitting to the steam track to force air pockets to flow in the same direction as water
	-	reduce concentration of steam discharge
-	differential shock
	-	occurs when steam and water flow in the same direction at different velocities
		-	can cause a change in pressure
	-	avoided by properly sizing condensate lines
	-	also avoided by insulating pipes
