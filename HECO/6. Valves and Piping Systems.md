## Pipes

### Fluid Flow
- liquids
- continuity equation

#### Continuity Equation
![[Pasted image 20211112081358.png]]

$$
Q = AV
$$
Q: flow rate
A: area (size of pipe)
V: velocity

![[HECO/_attachments/6. Valves and Piping Systems_2021-11-12 08.14.18.excalidraw.md]]
$$
Q_{1} = Q_{2}
$$
$$ \begin{equation}
A_{1}V_{1}=A_{2}V_{2}
\end{equation} $$
- $A_2$ increases, so $V_2$ decreases
- $A_3$ decreases, so $V_3$ increases

#### General Energy Equation
$$
PE + KE + FE
$$
P: potential energy
K: kinetic energy (proportional to $V^{2}$)
F: flow energy (proportional to pressure $\rho$)

$$
PE_{1}+KE_{1}+FE_{1}=PE_{2}+KE_{2}+FE_{2}
$$
- if one parameter changes, so does another parameter in order to satisfy conservation of energy

$$
V_{1}^{2}+P_{1} = V_{2}^{2}+P_{2}
$$

## Pipe Material
- most common:
	- alloy steel
	- carbon steel
- stainless steel
- copper (common in households for drinkin, used in low pressure, does not corrode the water)
- brass ()
- plastic (e.g ABS, PVC, CPVC, polyethylene) (common in house plumbing)
