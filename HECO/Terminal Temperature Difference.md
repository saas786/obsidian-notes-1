### Thermal Temperature Difference (TTD)

The measure of the effectiveness of heat transfer between the steam and feedwater in the feedwater heater.

TTD = (saturation temperature of the steam in the heater's condensing section) - (feedwater outlet temperature)

As the TTD goes down, the efficiency goes up. TTD should be as small as possible.
