# Compressed Air System
Section 23

Function:
-	Deliver reliable supply ot clean, dry, compressed air at a stable pressure to every end user

Considerations:
-	Air Flow - supply must be adequate to meet demand
-	Air Pressure - equipment operating pressure requirements
-	Air Quality

## Sources of Pressure Drops
-	Plumbing: piping, hoses, fittings, valves
	-	Longer pipe length -> more pressure drop
	-	Smaller pipe diameter -> more pressure drop (1" difference = 4x pressure lost)
	-	Pipe diameter -> changes flow, speed, pressure
-	Equipment: filters, dryers, aftercoolers, moisture separators, regulators
-	Leaks

## Air Quality
-	clean, dry air

>5. Air compressors are started up ________
a. automatically
b. manually
c. both

>6. The compressor only supplies air and requires jacket cooling water when it is
a. unloaded
b. loaded

>7. List two causes of compressor overheating.

>8. List two causes of compressor motor overload.

>9. What is the purpose of the pressure reducing stations?

>10. Service Air is supplied at _______ psig.

>11. Instrument Air is supplied at _______ psig, psig, and ----- psig

>12. The absorbing agent in air dryers is called a desiccant. True \ False

>13. Describe how the Air Dryer dries the air stream. 

>14. Name the main components in a compressed air system.
