# Hydrogen and Seal Oil System
Section 21

Hydrogen is used to cool the generator.

Helium vs. Hydrogen
-	Helium
	-	scarce
	-	high cost
-	Hydrogen
	-	abundant, available
	-	relatively low cost
	-	lower density
	-	high thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients
	-	pure -> free of dirt and moisture
		-	increases life of insulation of stator winding
	-	reduced windage noise
	
## Enclosed Systems
-	gas circulated by fans on the rotor
-	flows through machine, picks up heat
-	flows through finned tube coolers (ACW in tubeside)
-	cooled gas circles back through fans

## Hydrogen Gas System
-	provide means for safely putting hydrogen in or taking it out
-	maintain gas pressu
