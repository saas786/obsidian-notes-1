# Hydrogen and Seal Oil System
Section 21

Hydrogen is used to cool the generator.

Helium vs. Hydrogen
-	Helium
	-	scarce
	-	high cost
-	Hydrogen
	-	abundant, available
	-	relatively low cost
	-	lower density
	-	high thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients
	-	pure -> free of dirt and moisture
		-	increases life of insulation of stator winding
	-	reduced windage noise
	
## Enclosed Systems
-	gas circulated by fans on the rotor
-	flows through machine, picks up heat
-	flows through finned tube coolers (ACW in tubeside)
-	cooled gas circles back through fans

## Hydrogen Gas System
-	provide means for safely putting hydrogen in or taking it out
-	maintain gas pressure at desired value (30 psi @ K2)
-	indicate to operator condition of machine with regards to gas pressure, temperature, and purity (>98%)
-	indicate presence of water in machine
-	dry gas and remove water vapor

## Hydrogen Seal Oil System
-	prevent hydrogen from escaping
-	lubricate seal rings
-	minimize air, moisture, oil, and other contaminants that get in the generator so the hydrogen purity can be maintained

## Seal Oil System
Equipment:
-	Vacuum Tank
	-	removes gases & water vapor entrained in oil
	-	provides oil storage
-	Vacuum Pump
	-	maintain vacuum in the vacuum tank to facilitate removal of any entrained air, gas, and moisture
-	Separator Tank
	-	condenses exhausts from the vacuum pump and vents the gases to atmosphere
	-	collects water - water settles to the bottom and must be drained
	-	tracks volume of water drained to use as a problem indicator
-	Drain Regulator
	-	regulates oil coming from the hydrogen side drain of the defoaming tank
		-	want to maintain oil level about center of tank
	-	provides oil seal barrier between hydrogen and air side drains
-	Cuno Filter
	-	filters high pressure oil going to the turbine oil system
-	AC Pump
	-	normal seal oil supply
	-	regulated to 12psi greater than gas pressure at the seals
-	Seal Oil Cooler
-	Defoaming Tank
	-	assists in removing any entrained hydrogen in the oil
	-	foam layer floats on oil, keeps foam in defoaming tank allowing foam time to break down
	-	level in tank is maintained by the overflow connections
-	DC Pump (Emergency)
	-	does not maintain purity of hydrogen as well as AC pump
	-	last supply of seal oil designed to maintain hydrogen in the generator during a loss of all AC power
	-	maintains a seal oil pressure at 12psi greater than gas pressure
-	Seal Oil Pressure Regulators
	-	balanced disc valves
	-	main regulator maintains seal oil at 12psi above generator gas pressure
	-	backup regulator maintains seal oil at 8psi above generator gas pressure
	-	spring bias is used to set the pressure control point
-	Generator Loop Seal
	-	prevents a release of hydrogen from the generator to the lube oil reservoir in the event of a seal failure, or when the vacuum tank is not in service
-	Seal Oil Return Tank
-	Back Up Regulator
-	ACW Line to Seal Oil Cooler
-	Vacuum Pump

Backup Mode:
-	Seal oil pressure at seal drops to 8 psi greater than generator gas pressure
	-	Backup regulator opens to maintain 8psi over gas
	-	Backup supply from turbine lube oil system
-	Hydrogen purity degrades
	-	Vacuum tank bypassed
	-	contaminants present in seal oil
	-	additional hydrogen needed daily to maintain purity

Emergency Mode:
-	If seal oil pressure drops to 5psi greater than generator gas pressure
	-	DC seal oil pump starts
	-	Main regulator maintains 12psi over gas pressure
	-	Short term - no other backup if DC trips or fails

When must system be in operation:
-	prior to placing the turbine on turning gear
-	prior to any gases being admitted into the generator enclosure

Alarms:
-	defoaming tank high level alarm
-	drain regulator H2 side low level alarm
-	seal oil low pressure alarm - 5 psid
-	emergency seal oil pump starts with seal oil pressure drops to 5psi over gas pressure
-	seal oil pump off - when seal oil pump discharge drops to 5psig

>1. The major limit to generator capability is the ability of the design to cool which material?

copper

>2. What are the advantages of hydrogen over air with respect to generator cooling?

>3. Cooling active conductors internally has allowed for an increase in the capacities of generators. True \ False

true

>4. Liquid has better heat transfer characteristics as compared with gas. True \ False

false

>5. An explosion could occur if hydrogen is mixed with ________ .

air

>6. The pumps that maintain stator cooling water circulation may be started ________ .
>a. automatically.
>b. manually.
>c. both of the above.

both of the above

>7. The pressure of oil maintained on the seal at all times must be higher than hydrogen pressure to provide adequate sealing. True \ False

true

>8. Oil will absorb moisture and gas. True \ False 

true

>9. How does absorption of moisture and gas affect the hydrogen system?

-	lowers the purity of the hydrogen
-	increases windage
-	decreases efficiency

>10. What system provides seal oil backup?

turbine lube oil system

>11. In some gas dryers, the colored activated alumina is a ________ color when dry and changing to ________ when moist.

blue to grayish-pink

>12. Hydrogen gas systems are all provided with some means of reading machine gas purity. Two of these are:

1.	purity meter (changes thermal conductivity)
2.	density meter

>13. What is used as an intermediate gas when changing either from air to hydrogen or hydrogen to air in a generator? Why is this gas used?

carbon dioxide; CO2 is an inert gas that doesn't react with hydrogen

>14. Under normal operating conditions, the hydrogen purity in a vacuum system is maintained at a value of 94-96%. True \ False

false; 98-99%

>15. Describe the difference(s) in the oil supplied to the seals with the vacuum system in service and without the vacuum system in service.

-	no vacuum system
	-	less clean gas
	-	lower purity gas

>16. Why do we have a seal oil system?

prevents the hydrogen from escaping the generator

>17. To prevent the escape of gas along the shaft of a hydrogen cooled turbine generator, ________ seals supplied with oil under pressure are used. 

shaft or glands

>18. Discuss, briefly, the purpose of the defoaming tanks.

removes the foam from the oil; the foam contains hydrogen
