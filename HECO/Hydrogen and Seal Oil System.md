# Hydrogen and Seal Oil System
Section 21

Hydrogen is used to cool the generator.

Helium vs. Hydrogen
-	Helium
	-	scarce
	-	high cost
-	Hydrogen
	-	abundant, available
	-	relatively low cost
	-	lower density
	-	high thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients
	-	pure -> free of dirt and moisture
		-	increases life of insulation of stator winding
	-	reduced windage noise
	
## Enclosed Systems
-	gas circulated by fans on the rotor
-	flows through machine, picks up heat
-	flows through finned tube coolers (ACW in tubeside)
-	cooled gas circles back through fans

## Hydrogen Gas System
-	provide means for safely putting hydrogen in or taking it out
-	maintain gas pressure at desired value (30 psi @ K2)
-	indicate to operator condition of machine with regards to gas pressure, temperature, and purity (>98%)
-	indicate presence of water in machine
-	dry gas and remove water vapor

## Hydrogen Seal Oil System
-	prevent hydrogen from escaping
-	lubricate seal rings
-	minimize air, moisture, oil, and other contaminants that get in the generator so the hydrogen purity can be maintained

## Seal Oil System
Equipment:
-	Vacuum Tank
	-	removes gases & water vapor entrained in oil
	-	provides oil storage
-	Vacuum Pump
	-	maintain vacuum in the vacuum tank to facilitate removal of any entrained air, gas, and moisture
-	Separator Tank
	-	condenses exhausts from the vacuum pump and vents the gases to atmosphere
	-	collects water - water settles to the bottom and must be drained
	-	tracks volume of water drained to use as a problem indicator
-	Drain Regulator
	-	regulates oil coming from the hydrogen side drain of the defoaming tank
		-	want to maintain oil level about center of tank
	-	provides oil seal barrier between hydrogen and air side drains
-	Cuno Filter
-	AC Pump
	-	normal seal oil supply
	-	regulated to 12psi greater than gas pressure at the seals
-	Seal Oil Cooler
-	Defoaming Tank
-	DC Pump (Emergency)
	-	does not maintain purity of hydrogen as well as AC pump
	-	last supply of seal oil designed to maintain hydrogen in the generator during a loss of all AC power
	-	maintains a seal oil pressure at 12psi greater than gas pressure
-	Seal Oil Pressure Regulators
	-	balanced disc valves
	-	main regulator maintains seal oil at 12psi above generator gas pressure
	-	backup regulator maintains seal oil at 8psi above generator gas pressure
	-	spring bias is used to set the pressure control point
	-	
-	Seal Oil Return Tank
-	Back Up Regulator
-	ACW Line to Seal Oil Cooler
-	Vacuum Pump
