Functions:
-	provide hydrogen to the generator in order to cool it
-	provide a means of safely adding or taking out hydrogen from the system to maintain a desired pressure (30 psi) and a desired purity (98-99%)
-	indicate to operator condition of machine with regards to gas pressure, temperature, and purity
-	indicate presence of water in machine
-	ensure the hydrogen is dry and any water vapor is removed

Helium vs. Hydrogen
-	Helium
	-	scarce
	-	high cost
-	Hydrogen
	-	abundant, available
	-	relatively low cost
	-	lower density
	-	high thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients (absorbs 7x more heat than air)
	-	pure -> free of dirt and moisture
		-	increases life of insulation of stator winding
	-	reduced windage noise
	
Hydrogen is highly explosive when mixed with air. If a mixture of hydrogen and air contains 4-75% hydrogen, then the slightest spark can ignite it.
	
## Enclosed System Flow
-	gas circulated by fans on the rotor
-	flows through machine, picks up heat
-	flows through finned tube coolers (ACW in tubeside)
-	cooled gas circles back through fans
