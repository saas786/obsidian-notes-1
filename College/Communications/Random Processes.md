# Random Processes
---

Consider a random process $X(t),\ t \in \mathcal{R}$. A random process is defined as a collection of random variables indexed by parameter $t$.
Note that $X(t_{1}), X(t_{2}), ..., X(t_{n})$ are all RVs and can be characterized by joint PDFs and joint CDFs.

## Characteristics

- Random process $X(t)$ is independant for all $t$. That is, $X(t_{1}), X(t_{2}), ..., X(t_{n})$ are jointly independant.
- Random process $X(t)$ is jointly Gaussian. That is, $X(t_{1}), X(t_{2}), ..., X(t_{n})$ are jointly Gaussian RVs.
