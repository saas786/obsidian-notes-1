## Histogram
A function that counts the number of observations that fall into a series of disjoint sets called **bins**.

$K$: number of bins
$B_{k}$: $k$th bin, $k = 1,...,K$

In image histograms, $K$ is the number of different pixel values (0 - 255) and $B_{k}$ is a bin containing how many pixels have the pixel value $k$.
