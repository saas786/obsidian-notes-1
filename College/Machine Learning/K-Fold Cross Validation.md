A method of estimating the skill of a machine learning model given a limited dataset.

Given an integer $k$, this process is known as a $k$-fold cross-validation. For example, if $k=5$, the process is known as a 5-fold cross-validation.

The process is:
1.	Shuffle the dataset
2.	Split the dataset into $k$ groups
3.	For each individual group
