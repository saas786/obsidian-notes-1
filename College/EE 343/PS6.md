# EE 343 Problem Set 6

1. 
__9.4-1__ Two independent random voltage processes $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ are applied to an RC network, as shown in figure 9.14. The two random noise processes have the following PSD:
$$
    S_{x_1} = \dfrac{2\alpha}{\alpha^2 + (j2\pi f)^2} \qquad S_{x_2} = K
$$
Find the PSD and the power $P_y$ of the output random process y(t).

__11.1-4__ An alternative to the optimum filter is a suboptimum filter, where we assume a particular filter form and adjust its parameters to maximize $\rho$. Such filters are inferior to the optimum filter but may be simpler to design.

For a rectangular pulse $p(t)$ of height $A$ and width $T_b$ at the input, determine $\rho_{max}$ if, instead of the matched filter, a one-stage RC filter with $H(\omega) = 1/(1 + j\omega Rc)$ is used. Assume a white Gaussian noise of PSD $\nu$
