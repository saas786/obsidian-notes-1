# Expectation
---

We define the expected value (also called the expectation or the mean) 
of a random variable X, with P MF PX, by:
$$
E[X] = \sum\limits_{x}xp_{X}(x)
$$

## Variance

The variance $var(X)$ of a random variable $X$ is defined by
$$
var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]
$$
and can be calculated as
$$
var(X) = \sum\limits_{x}(x-E[X])^{2}p_{X}(x)
$$
It is always nonnegative. Its square root is denoted by
