The term **ricing** originates from the term RICE in cars (Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancement). Ricing in Linux represents the practice of customizing your desktop UI, usually with no performance benefit.

## Display Manager (DM)
Provides a login screen and can automatically start the GUI on boot.

### LightDM | `lightdm`

## Window Manager (WM)
Controls the placement and appearance of windows within a desktop.

## Wallpaper Manager
Manages custom wallpapers.

### feh | `feh`

Commonly used like:

```
feh --bg-fill <image>
```

or with multiple monitors:

```
feh --bg-fill <image 1> --bg-fill <image 2>
```

Wallpapers that span multiple monitors must be split up before being used
as wallpapers for each monitor.

## Automatic Terminal Colors

Install `pywal`.

Commonly used like:

```
wal -i <image>
```

Use the `-n` flag to prevent it from setting the wallpaper.

Different backends can be used to vary your results. List them with:

```
wal --backend
```

And set it when running like:

```
wall -i <image> --backend <backend>
```

Note that these backends must also be installed.

### Fine-tuning color palettes

Install the `wpgtk` package to adjust the colors of a palette generated by `wal`.
Install the `gpick` package for a screen color picker.


## Compositors
Compositors can enhance the visuals of any desktop windows or panels.
